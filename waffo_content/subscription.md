Maximize LTV

## Take full control of your subscriptions with ease

Whether it's one-time purchases or recurring subscriptions, Waffo supports every business model: one-off charges, monthly or yearly billing, discounted or free trials, and usage-based billing — all simple to set up.

At the same time, we provide flexible subscription management — upgrades and downgrades, pausing and resuming, switching billing cycles — so your product runs smoothly across different scenarios.

By giving customers more seamless ways to subscribe and renew, Waffo helps you capture more revenue at both the first subscription and renewal stages, maximizing customer lifetime value (LTV).

Win more new Customers

## Optimize first subscription success rate

Make sure every customer with the intent to pay can successfully subscribe.

Waffo helps you analyze success rates, design custom checkout flows, and streamline payment steps to shorten time-to-complete. By opening up the top of the funnel, we turn more signups into real revenue and ensure your marketing spend never goes to waste.
