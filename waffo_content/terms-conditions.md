## Article 8: General Provisions

Links to third-party sites provided through the Services may lead you to leave https://waffo.ai or other sites of ours. Please note that the linked sites may not be under the ownership or control of Waffo in any manner whatsoever, and you therefore access them at your own risk. Waffo is not responsible for the contents, terms of use, or privacy practices of any such linked site, or any link contained within a linked site, including any changes or updates to such sites. The inclusion of any third-party link does not in any way imply or express affiliation, endorsement, or sponsorship by us of any linked site and/or any of its content therein.

We may make any notices that we may be required by law to make in electronic format (such as but not limited to when you visit https://waffo.ai and other sites of ours, via forms or emails, when Waffo posts notices or updates to these Terms, or when Waffo communicates with you via your email or mobile phone number). You consent to receive communications from us in electronic form and agree that all terms and conditions, notices, rules, disclosures, policies, and other communications from us provided electronically to you shall be deemed to satisfy any legal requirement relating to communications in writing and shall be deemed to be given on the date of the electronic communication.

You are responsible for any applicable taxes, duties, currency exchange fees, data charges, and related charges on purchases made through the Services.

Our failure or delay in enforcing any right or provision under these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver or limitation of our right to subsequently enforce any provision of these Terms and compel strict compliance therewith.

References to goods, services, and/or businesses on any of our sites do not constitute or imply an endorsement, approval or recommendation by Waffo of those goods, services and/or businesses.

Waffo may, at its sole discretion, terminate your access to https://waffo.ai and/or other sites of ours, the Services, and/or your account with us (if applicable) if you breach any of these Terms. In the event of termination, the provisions of the section on Indemnification and Liability shall survive.

Waffo takes all reasonable steps to preserve the security of the information that you provide to it. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as totally secure. Whilst Waffo strives to protect all data transmissions over the Internet (including your information) and has adopted substantial measures to mitigate security risks, Waffo does not warrant and cannot ensure the absolute security of any information which you transmit to Waffo. As such, any information which you transmit to Waffo is transmitted at your own risk.

Nothing in these Terms is intended to or creates any type of joint venture, employee-employer, creditor-debtor, escrow, partnership, or any fiduciary relationship between you and Waffo.

You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under the provisions of these Terms, or any part of it, to any other party without our prior written approval. Any attempt by you to do so without our prior written approval shall be deemed null and void. We are, however, entitled to assign the provisions of these Terms and/or any of our obligations, in whole or in part, at any time, to any of our affiliate or subsidiary or any third party, with or without notice to you.

These Terms were prepared in English. To the extent that any translated localised version of the Terms conflict with the English version, the terms of the English version prevail.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Waffo, and supersede and cancel all prior and contemporaneous agreements, claims, representations, and understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. No modification or amendment of these Terms will be binding on Waffo unless agreed to by Waffo, set forth in writing, and published in the same manner as previously binding versions.

If any of the provisions of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

These Terms shall be governed by and construed according to the laws of Hong Kong.

We shall endeavour to amicably resolve any disputes that arise out of or in connection with these Terms (including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination), but in the event that such efforts shall fail, such dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre ("HKIAC") in accordance with the rules of the HKIAC ("HKIAC Rules") for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Article on Governing Law. The seat of arbitration shall be Hong Kong, and the Tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator. All arbitration proceedings shall be in the English language. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.
