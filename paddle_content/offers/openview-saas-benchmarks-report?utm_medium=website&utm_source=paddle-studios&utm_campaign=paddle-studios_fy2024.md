**Key Insights:**

  1. While growth is much harder to come by in 2023, there are pockets of resilience amid the doom-and-gloom.
  2. The North Star for many has become ARR per FTE, which reflects the productivity of your team. We’ve seen big increases in ARR per FTE year-on-year.
  3. Positioning yourself as “AI” doesn’t impact growth. But monetizing AI does.
  4. To drive productivity, companies need efficient product-led growth (PLG), expansion within the customer base, and improved operations.
