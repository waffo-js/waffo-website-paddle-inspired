## Unlock freedom with  
third-party payments

App developers with users in the US are now allowed to link to third-party payments, without any additional fees or restrictions. 

Save on App Store fees and keep more money to reinvest in your app’s growth. Get more control of your cash flow without waiting up to 60 days for payouts.

Run time-limited sales, special bundles and other pricing options otherwise not possible on the App Store.

Collect emails, demographic data, and communicate directly with your customers to drive personalized engagement.

Implement cancellation flows that offer alternatives when users try to cancel, like pausing subscriptions or special retention offers.

## Why choose Paddle for  
external payments?  
We give you MoR.

Standard Payment Service Providers (PSPs) aren’t set up to handle all of the operational burden of selling apps on the web. Managing payments, fraud prevention, refunds and chargebacks, buyer support, and sales tax now becomes your direct responsibility. 

As a Merchant of Record (MoR), Paddle handles the entire sales process end-to-end for you. So, just like the App Store, we take care of payments, refunds and compliance without any additional effort on your part.

All for a single, transparent fee and no hidden costs.
