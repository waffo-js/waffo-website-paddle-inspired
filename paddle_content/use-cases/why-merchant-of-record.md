Land & expand customers with modern SaaS experiences

De-risk your payments with a more reliable infrastructure

## What is a merchant of record (MoR)? 

An MoR is paid by your end customer and handles all of the payment infrastructure and tax liability related to each transaction.

We’re incorporated and have a local bank account wherever you need one. We’re registered to collect and remit taxes. We’re integrated with all the popular local payment gateways.

You’ll get all of the above without losing control over your customers and product.

## Why is Paddle the right model for you

Paddle uses the proven MOR business model and applies it to a modern, fast-growing payment infrastructure. For the best of both worlds. So you can have complete confidence in your payment partner.

The bottom line: less time maintaining a legacy system, more time growing with a reliable, modern Merchant of Record.
