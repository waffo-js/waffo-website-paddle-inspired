You need to evaluate available methods carefully and pick the most suitable for your business.

This post looks at the different types of payment methods, discussing the pros and cons to help you make the most suitable decision for your business.

## **How to choose the best payment method for your business**

Providing too many [payment methods](https://www.paddle.com/blog/billing-schedule) can sometimes bring confusion for your customers. It's better to narrow down the payment options your customers are most likely to use. The choice of payment depends on the following factors:

### **Location**

The primary payment method must be suitable for both the company and the customer based on their location. You may need to provide preferred payment methods for [customers in different countries](https://www.paddle.com/blog/saas-localized-pricing).

### **Omnichannel approach**

If your customers use both online and offline services, it's prudent to incorporate both into your business. You may need to offer both DTC and B2B payment options if your business offers both. Base your business payment options on where your demographic lies.

### **Business model**

Automatic or manual [payment methods](https://www.profitwell.com/recur/all/b2b-payments-and-processing) need to be set up for recurring billing cycles. Manual means you collect the payments yourself. But with automatic payments, customers choose one payment method to be auto-charged on renewal of the billing cycle.

Automatic payments sometimes run into hurdles, such as credit card cancellation or forgetting to update their credit card information. Even if you set up backup [payment methods, they may also fail](https://www.paddle.com/resources/payment-failure).

## **Top payment solutions for saas companies**

### **Paddle**

Paddle provides a [merchant of record payments and billing solution](/blog/what-is-merchant-of-record) for SaaS companies. It supports various payment methods out of the box and easily lets you localize your payment and currency options by location. Paddle also takes care of sales tax calculations and filing on your transactions.

### **Stripe**

It is a hybrid billing system but requires integration into a subscription management platform. [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-gb-us) is easy to use, and [integrating takes only a few minutes](https://www.paddle.com/help/profitwell-metrics/setup/get-started/stripe-integration-using-stripe-as-a-billing-system-subscription-management-solution). It's friendly to new and small businesses, while its built-in API makes it perfect for designers and developers, but the per-card charge means the pricing can be prohibitive for large companies. Users stay on the site when making payments since it doesn't redirect them.   
  


### **Zuora**

[Zuora](https://www.zuora.com) can capture data across all sales channels and supports 50 charge models and over 180 currencies.

### **Chargify**

[Chargify](https://www.chargify.com) also offers a free trial plan. The month-to-month subscription, dunning, and [easy-to-use](https://www.paddle.com/help/profitwell-metrics/setup/get-started/connecting-chargify-to-your-profit-well-account) interface are helpful to customers. But, it is pretty expensive, and some people feel overwhelmed by its many features.  
  


### **Braintree**

You can integrate this hybrid billing system into your merchant accounts. [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com) works with any payment gateway across all platforms, such as mobile phones and websites. It serves various users and is available worldwide. No subscription is required, but since it charges per transaction, if your volume increases, it can be costly.  
  


### **Chargebee**

[Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com) offers a free option if you are not ready to commit to the paid plans. It provides customizable payments, such as pay-as-you-go, flat-fee, or a customized plan. The only drawback is the expensive paid plan.
