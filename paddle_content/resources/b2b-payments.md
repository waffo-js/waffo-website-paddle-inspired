## What are B2B payments?

B2B payments (or business-to-business payments) are transactions between two merchants. B2B payments are conducted between corporations, startups, retailers, wholesalers, etc., with unique transactional requirements in mind. While similar to business-to-customer (B2C) payments, B2B payments have additional processes in place that make them more complex.

## How B2B payments differ from B2C payments

When businesses make payments to one another, more steps are involved in processing each transaction that go beyond those traditionally found in B2C payments. These steps are in place to mitigate potential issues that arise as a result of the scale, method, and contract of B2B payments. Understanding these underlying rules help you get a handle on why certain platforms provide the features that they do.

### Volume

B2B payments are traditionally much larger than B2C payments. [Research has shown](https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/list/data-b2b-payments-go-digital) the average B2B ACH debit transaction to be $41,118, while the average for consumers was $44.

### Type of contract

B2B payments are under more scrutiny than B2C payments. There are more rules and regulations dictating how and when payments are made, as well as the payment method being used. Whether it’s contractual obligations or federal oversight, these regulations result in the need for more process standardization that typically wouldn’t exist in the business-to-consumer payments space.

### Payment method

The [payment method](https://www.paddle.com/resources/payment-methods) usedfor B2B payments is more important than the method used for B2C payments. When B2B payments fail, it means the purchasing company will likely lose a vital component of their business infrastructure. Business-to-customer payments also tend to be more variable than B2B payments, where contracts define the payment terms. Understanding the B2B payment landscape and how it differs from B2C payment systems helps you nail down which platform is the best fit for your business.  


## 5 ways businesses collect B2B payments

There are a number of different methods for processing payments between two businesses. We’ll explore the top 5 most common B2B payment methods and how they impact your business.

### Credit cards

Credit card payments are a standard way to collect payments online for lots of businesses, including SaaS providers and [ecommerce subscription platforms](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics). While they are a reliable payment method for B2B companies, most credit card payments come with percentage fees. When you’re processing a significant volume of payments, these fees can compound quickly to become too expensive.

Some credit cards will also have a maximum transaction limit, making it impossible to process larger payments. Hitting the credit card limit can also lead to [delinquent churn](https://www.profitwell.com/recur/all/youre-handling-delinquent-churn-incorrectly), one of the biggest contributors to SaaS and subscription churn.

### Bank/Wire transfers

Bank and wire transfers are secure payments between financial institutions. These types of payments typically take a lot of work to set up but, once completed, are very reliable. While there are fees involved in these kinds of transfers, there is no limit to the amount that can be sent between banks.

### Checks

Checks may feel antiquated, but there are businesses that still accept them as payment. While this is a reliable and easy-to-track payment method, checks do take a lot of time to process. There is also more room for error with handwritten paper checks due to poor handwriting and the lack of an electronic paper trail.

Any physical form of payment like this brings up logistical issues as well. You’ll either have to deliver the check in person or mail it to the other business, both of which add a layer of overhead to an already complicated process.

### Cash

Cash payments are the least reliable and most cumbersome method for B2B payments. Anything over a few hundred dollars will be difficult to keep track of in transit. That, combined with the fact that large cash payments have significant [regulations](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/form-8300-and-reporting-cash-payments-of-over-10000) regarding their use, makes this a very inefficient way to make B2B payments.

### Payment gateways

[Payment gateways](https://www.paddle.com/alternatives/international-payment-gateway) are the most popular way to process B2B payments—they facilitate financial transactions for your business and make it easy to collect both subscription and one-time payments. While you’ll still rely on a third-party payment service to process these payments, the software available to facilitate these payments is built to streamline the billing process as much as possible.

That said, using a payment platform requires an understanding of exactly what features these tools offer and how they differ—as we’ll cover in the next section.
