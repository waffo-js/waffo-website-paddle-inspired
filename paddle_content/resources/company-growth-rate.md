## **What is company growth rate?**

A [company growth rate](https://www.paddle.com/resources/growth-rate) measures specific variables associated with growth over a specific period and is expressed as a percentage. The variables are industry-specific, meaning they differ from one company to another. While a department store may be more concerned with retail sales, a SaaS company might emphasize revenue and account growth. 

Some of the [growth rates](https://www.paddle.com/resources/revenue-run-rate) that a company may measure include revenue, [user acquisition](https://www.paddle.com/resources/customer-acquisition-vs-retention), and compound annual growth rates. This metric is an indicator of whether a business is profitable and can be measured at any growth stage. Investors use the numbers to determine if a business is worth funding, while executives use them to plan and allocate resources. 

## **Company growth rate formula**

As an investor, business owner, or manager, it’s crucial you learn how to calculate the growth rate of a company. The basic company growth rate formula is easy to understand and apply. It’s the difference between the current period value and the previous period value divided by the previous period value multiplied by 100%. 

For example, to calculate the revenue growth rate: 

 _Revenue growth rate = (Current period revenue - Previous period revenue) / Previous period revenue x 100%_

You can apply the company growth rate formula to any metric of your choosing. You need to have the current and previous values for the period in question. Substitute the figures in the formula, calculate, and you have your company growth rate. But the figures need to be carefully evaluated with several things in mind to get the right conclusions out of them.

For instance, if you do not factor [churn rate](https://www.paddle.com/resources/calculate-churn-rate) into the formula, the results may be deceiving. Consider the following example. You may see a constant growth rate of 10% over several months, which is good. But where is the growth coming from? Is it from new or old customers? Because if you’re getting new customers every month, shouldn't your business [revenue growth](https://www.paddle.com/resources/revenue-growth) rate be increasing instead of remaining constant? You may find you’re actually losing customers while gaining new ones who are responsible for maintaining the growth at 10%. Ultimately, this strong growth rate hides a high churn rate that may lead your business to stagnation if not checked. 

Also, growth rate during short months and certain seasons may be deceptive depending on your business. Some months may be shorter due to holidays. The rate may be higher in the long months as there is more time to generate revenue. Hence, it’s essential to understand the factors affecting the growth in your business so you’re in a position to put your company growth rates into perspective.

## **What are the different types of company growth?**

In this section, we look at various types of company growth rate metrics to help you better understand your organization's figures. 

### 

### Industry growth rate 

Different industries have different growth rates and benchmarks. It’s wise to benchmark against those in the same industry when comparing your business. For instance, the retail industry, which has been around for some time, will have a different benchmark compared to companies dealing with cutting-edge technology. 

Also, growth in some industries may be cyclic with high growth during periods of economic expansion and low growth during a recession. But even if historical data indicates growth during certain time periods, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll experience the same high growth rate if a similar event comes around again. The reason is that economic and industrial conditions may differ from past conditions. 

### 

### Seasonal growth 

Seasonal businesses tend to enjoy growth during certain seasons and slump during others. For example, if your SaaS company sells services to students, you may experience decreases in sales when schools close and a spike in revenue when they open. Similarly, an ecommerce store may see an increase in sales during the holiday season followed by returns and cancellations soon after the holidays. 

Understanding your company's growth rate may be more difficult for you as you can’t compare one month to the other. If you do, the figures won't make sense. But comparing the same month's performance year-over-year helps you gauge trends more accurately.

### 

### Compound annual growth rates (CAGR) 

Compound annual growth rates refer to a company's average annual growth rate over a specified period. The assumption here is that returns are reinvested every year, and the growth rate ultimately remains steady.

The formula for calculating CAGR: 

 _CAGR=((Ending value)/(Beginning value))^(1/n)-1_

 _Where n is the number of years_

Generating the same amount of revenue as a business grows actually results in declining growth. This happens because revenue as a percentage of overall revenue keeps getting smaller. To consistently grow, companies must generate compound growth or grow at a faster rate every period.
