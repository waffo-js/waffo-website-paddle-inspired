Which countries require Enhanced Billing Notifications?

To comply with increasing regulatory requirements and card scheme rules, we're introducing Enhanced Billing Notifications. These notifications will automatically inform buyers, when required, of key billing events, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of chargebacks.

These emails include:

  * **Free Trial End Reminder** : Customers will receive an email notification at least 7 days before their free trial ends.
  * **Discounted Period End Reminder** : Customers will be notified via email at least 7 days before a discounted period concludes.
  * **Auto-Renewal Reminder** : Depending on the customer's location, and only for subscription periods of 6 months or longer, customers will get an email notification either 7 days or 30 days before the auto-renewal.


You can learn more about these emails [here](https://www.paddle.com/help/manage/your-customers/which-emails-will-customers-receive-on-paddle-billing).

## FAQs

  


**Auto-renewal notifications apply to subscription 6 months or longer. My subscriptions are usually for 180 days, which is less than 6 months.**

Our policy considers 180 days as a cutoff because it approximates six months, aligning with global legal standards and best practices for longer billing cycles. The legal interpretation of a _calendar month_ typically refers to a period from a specific date in one month to the corresponding date in the next, but for consistency across different jurisdictions, we use 180 days as a standardized measure.

Many jurisdictions treat billing cycles of 180 days or longer as long-term commitments requiring additional consumer protections, such as renewal reminders. This approach is also in line with _Card Scheme_ requirements. We hope this clarifies things. As for the impact on customer behaviour, we've carefully balanced compliance requirements with the need to avoid negatively impacting customer behaviour ensuring that our approach is as convenient as possible for our suppliers.

  


**Can I turn off the subscriptions for all our customers?**

We cannot turn these notifications off as these notifications are essential to ensure regulatory compliance. Free trial end and discount end reminders are required by card scheme rules, while auto-renewal reminders for subscriptions that are 6 months or longer are legally required in various jurisdictions and required by card scheme rules. See the full list of regions above.

  


**Can I customise the cadence and copy of these emails?**

No. The cadence and content of these emails have been carefully designed to comply with regulatory requirements for subscription notifications. We’ve worked very closely with our Legal, Risk, and Product teams to balance the need for compliance with the general user experience. You can be rest assured that these emails cover the necessary information including common questions raised by buyers.

  


**But won't notifying customers of renewals impact churn?**

We have taken a nuanced approach to these notifications and therefore expect minimal impact on churn. There are two things to remember. Firstly, we’re not sending renewal notifications to monthly subscriptions, only to subscriptions that are 6 months or longer. Secondly, auto-renewal reminder emails will only be sent to buyers in jurisdictions where we are legally required to. See the full list of regions above. We will continue to keep an eye on these laws around the world, and will adjust these billing notifications as the laws change.

  


**Does the introduction of Enhanced Billing Notifications mean we were previously at risk of non-compliance?**

Enhanced Billing Notifications represent our ongoing commitment to proactively enhance compliance with evolving regulations. This release is part of our continuous effort to ensure you remain compliant in all applicable jurisdictions. By taking these steps, we are confident that our current practices effectively mitigate any risk of non-compliance.

  


**Which countries require Enhanced Billing Notifications?**

The full list of regions where we send Enhanced Billing Notifications can be found above.

  


**How are the various timelines for the subscription notifications decided?**

These timelines are based on card scheme requirements and enacted laws in jurisdictions that have subscription notification requirements.
