How do I issue refunds?

### If you've been charged by paddle.net and would like to request a refund, [please click here](https://paddle.net/).

* * *

### If you are a _Paddle seller_

If you sell with Paddle, please follow the instructions in the section below to initiate a refund on behalf of your customer.

You can issue a full or partial refund on any order.

To issue a refund, follow the steps below;

  * Visit the Transactions page in your Paddle dashboard.
  * Lookup or select the order you wish to refund and open the order details page.
  * In the top-right-hand corner of the page select the “Refund” button.
  * An overlay will appear on the screen requesting whether you’d like to offer a full refund or partial refund and a field to enter the refund reason. This reason will be included in our refund webhooks [here](https://developer.paddle.com/build/transactions/create-transaction-adjustments#related-notifications) for Paddle Billing, and the [Subscription Payment Refunded](https://developer.paddle.com/webhook-reference/4974afe939abc-subscription-payment-refunded) or [Payment Refunded](https://developer.paddle.com/webhook-reference/4faca722a5181-payment-refunded) alerts on Paddle Classic.


Card refunds typically take 3-5 working days to credit back into the customer’s account.

PayPal refunds typically re-appear in a customer’s account within 48 hours of requesting the refund. 

**Limitations**

Some payment methods impose limits on what transactions you can refund. For example, card payments can only be refunded on transactions less than 120 days old, and PayPal payments if it is less than 179 days old.

If you are unable to refund a particular order or have questions about the above, don’t hesitate to get in touch with the Paddle team [here](mailto:sellers@paddle.com).
