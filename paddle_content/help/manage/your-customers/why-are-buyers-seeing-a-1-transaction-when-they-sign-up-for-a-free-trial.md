Why are buyers seeing a $1 transaction when they sign up for a free trial?

Buyers may see a $1.00 charge on their statement for free trials. This is a pre-authentication to ensure if it's a real payment card or PayPal but there won't be any charge made if the trial is free.

This transaction will drop from the buyer’s statement shortly and they will not be charged.
