How to find an order

Sometimes your buyers may reach out to you to match an order to an unidentified charge on their bank statement. Most buyers contact our Buyer Support team directly, but they may also contact you for advice, as your company name is seen in the statement descriptor. 

To find the transaction, you can use the transactions page on the Paddle dashboard. For this search, you can input the email address or transaction ID on Paddle Billing, or the order ID, subscription ID, email address, coupon used for the transaction on Paddle Classic, to find an order. If that search yields no results, which is likely when the buyer had a typo in their email address or used a different email address for their purchase altogether, you can reach out to Paddle’s Customer Support team and ask for help locating the order. Simply email [sellers@paddle.com](mailto:sellers@paddle.com) or reach out to the team via the chat function from your Paddle dashboard.
