Resending lost Invoices & Emails

 _This is only applicable to Paddle Classic_

Occasionally emails delivered to customers will be lost. You’re able to resend, forward, or preview any email relating to an order. To do this follow the steps below:

  * Visit the [Transactions page in your Paddle dashboard](http://vendors.paddle.com/orders).
  * Lookup or select the order associated with the invoice and/or email you’d like to resend/forward/preview - eventually reaching its unique order page.
  * Under “Order History” you should see a list of all emails we’ve attempted to deliver to the customer.
    * Examples: Receipt emails, Delivery emails, [Checkout Recovery](https://www.paddle.com/help/start/set-up-paddle/what-is-checkout-recovery) emails
  * Next to each of these, you should see the relevant options to “Resend”, “Forward” or “Preview”.
