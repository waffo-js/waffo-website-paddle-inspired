Can I contact my customers from Audience?

_This is only applicable to Paddle Classic_

No. Currently, you can export customers from the Audience area, and contact them via a platform/email provider of your choice.

_Note: Under[GDPR legislation](https://paddle.com/blog/rolling-out-gdpr) you’re only able to contact those customers who have opted-in to receive marketing communications from you as the seller. The Audience export makes it clear who has given consent to be contacted (opted-in), and what products they’re interested in_.
