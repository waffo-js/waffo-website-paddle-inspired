## Email Localization

Paddle automatically translates these emails into the 16 languages currently supported in the Checkout: English, French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Italian, Polish, Dutch, Arabic, Chinese (simplified), Korean, Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian. This means customers will receive all subscription and transaction emails in the language they checkout in, which can help decrease involuntary churn and boost conversions in the post-purchase journey.

## Checkout Recovery With Discount

Paddle will send an e-mail to customers who abandon the checkout to encourage them to complete it. An additional 10% transaction fee applies to checkouts we recover.

**Subject Line:** _Finish your Product Name purchase..._

# Enhanced Billing Notifications

To comply with increasing regulatory requirements and card scheme rules, we’ve introduced Enhanced Billing Notifications. When required, these notifications will automatically inform buyers of key billing events, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of chargebacks.

We have developed these notifications with input from our Design, Legal, and Compliance teams to deliver a targeted, nuanced solution, that ensures optimal performance while ensuring compliance.
