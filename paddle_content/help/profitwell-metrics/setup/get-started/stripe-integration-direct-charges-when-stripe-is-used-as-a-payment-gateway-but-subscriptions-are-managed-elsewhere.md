Stripe integration: using Stripe as a payment gateway for subscriptions

If you use Stripe to handle your payments, then you can use ProfitWell. There are 2 types of use cases in general:

  * For [Stripe as a billing system](https://learn.profitwell.com/article/3xs0lskrvu-stripe-integration-using-stripe-as-a-billing-system-subscription-management-solution)/subscription management solution, you are both handling payments and managing subscriptions within Stripe. In this case, you can use ProfitWell for [Metrics](https://www.profitwell.com/) and [Retain](https://www.profitwell.com/churn-reduction-software).
  * For **Stripe as a payment gateway** , you are using Stripe to accept payments, but you manage your subscriptions on another platform. In this case, you can use ProfitWell for [Retain](https://www.profitwell.com/churn-reduction-software) and [cash flow](https://www.profitwell.com/recur/all/blog/cash-flow/) metrics only. Read below for more details.


If you are using Stripe as a payment gateway, then you likely fall into one of two buckets: you either manage subscriptions internally or on a subscription management solution built on top of Stripe, such as WooCommerce or Piano.

In all these cases, you can use ProfitWell Retain for Direct Charges: we can help you recover revenue through chasing failed payments from your past due customers.
