Do I need an SSL certificate to use Paddle?

HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP, is a protocol that helps keep buyers secure by encrypting the communications between their web browser and your server.

To uphold the highest standards of security, it is mandatory to have your site equipped with HTTPS through the acquisition of an SSL certificate. While the Paddle checkout is already HTTPS encrypted, it is imperative that you take the necessary steps to switch your site to HTTPS.
