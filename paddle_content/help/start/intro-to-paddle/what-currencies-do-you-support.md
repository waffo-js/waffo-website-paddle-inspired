What currencies do you support?

To help you sell your products throughout the world, Paddle accepts payments in a wide range of currencies. You can find a list of all currencies in our developer documentation:   
[Click here for currencies in Paddle Billing](https://developer.paddle.com/concepts/sell/supported-currencies)  
[Click here for currencies in Paddle Classic](https://developer.paddle.com/classic/reference/08d5d797e10ae-supported-currencies)

During setup, you must set a product’s base price and currency of your choice. This is used in two ways:

  1. If you choose to support additional currencies, we will automatically convert your product price into these currencies using the base price. Note that the converted price can be manually overridden to a specified price if you wish.
  2. If a customer is purchasing from a country whereby we don’t support their local currency, or if the country’s corresponding currency is disabled in the product, the customer will see the product’s base price and currency.


If you’re not sure if you should accept multiple currencies, you can read [our guide here](https://www.paddle.com/help/grow/localisation/why-should-i-use-local-currencies) for more information.
