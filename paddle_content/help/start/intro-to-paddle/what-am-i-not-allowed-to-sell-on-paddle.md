Understanding Paddle’s Acceptable Use Policy (AUP): What Am I Not Allowed To Sell?

Paddle is built to serve software companies (including B2B SaaS, Consumer Software, and Games). If your company’s primary offering is human services (such as consultation, support, or design services) or the sale of physical goods, Paddle is not a good fit for your needs.

While we have stipulated a series of forbidden business categories in this document, some overall restrictions on the use of Paddle include any business offering that:

  * Violates any rules or regulations of Card Brand Networks;

  * Violates any law or government regulation;

  * Involves fraudulent, deceptive, unfair, abusive or predatory practices;

  * Is marketed through the use of outbound telemarketing;

  * Threatens reputational damage to Paddle or any Card Brand Network;

  * Results in or causes a significant risk of chargebacks, fines, damages, or harm and liability;

  * Engages in, encourages, promotes, or celebrates violence or physical harm to persons or property, or toward any group based on race, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, or any other immutable characteristic

  * Contravenes the requirements for the provision of consent under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)


Some of the above may not be obvious or evident at the time of application, but Paddle reserves the right to exercise judgment in ascertaining whether any of these factors are likely to be present.

## Restricted Categories

Due to the increased risk on certain offerings, Paddle must do enhanced due diligence on certain product offerings. Should your offering be considered restricted, Paddle’s team will reach out to you for additional information if it is needed.

The above lists are reflective of our risk appetite and historical experience with onboarding software sellers and our knowledge of the market environment in which we operate. This is not an exhaustive list as the software landscape is continuously changing, presenting new business models that we must consider and evaluate.
