How do I change my vendor account name?

**Changing your vendor name**

The “Legal Name” should be your company name, its usage is explained below. “Contact Name” should be the name of the owner of the account - we’ll use this when a member of the team gets in touch.

To change your legal company name or display name, please contact [sellers@paddle.com](mailto:sellers@paddle.com) with a brief explanation of the reason for the change for us to assist.

**Where is the Legal Name used?**

Your Legal Name is included on your checkout as well as in emails* sent to customers after purchasing your products; helping them to identify their purchase.

*If the “Company Display Name” is set, we will use this within the customer emails instead.

Relating to this, we’d also recommend [setting the same “statement description” name](https://www.paddle.com/help/manage/your-customers/what-will-customers-see-on-their-statement) alongside your vendor name. This is used to help customers easily identify purchases on their bank statements.
