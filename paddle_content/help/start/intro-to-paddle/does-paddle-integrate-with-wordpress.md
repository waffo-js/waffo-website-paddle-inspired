Does Paddle integrate with WordPress?

**Paddle does not provide a plugin to integrate with WordPress.**

Customers may use [third-party plugins](https://wpsmartpay.com/) such as WPSmartPay or WooCommerce, which facilitate the integration. When selecting a plugin, please ensure it is compatible with your version of Paddle. Some plugins only work with Paddle Classic which is only available for customers who signed up before August 8th, 2023.

We do not take any responsibility for the product and do not provide technical support for these plugins. For any questions or support needs, you will need to reach out to the plugin developer directly.
