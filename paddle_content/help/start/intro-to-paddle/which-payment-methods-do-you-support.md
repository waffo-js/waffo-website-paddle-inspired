#### Do you accept cheque payments?

No, we don’t accept cheques as a payment method. If a cheque is sent to us, we are unable to process it and will securely dispose of it. We recommend using Wire Transfer/other accepted method for all payments.

See our documentation section [here for Paddle Billing](https://developer.paddle.com/concepts/payment-methods/overview) and [here for Paddle Classic](https://developer.paddle.com/classic/reference/1ee1d29c64a53-payment-methods) for more details and restrictions.

You will not need any merchant accounts with any payment gateway, PayPal, or Apple Pay; only your Paddle account. We manage the relationship with PayPal and our payment processors to ensure that all our sellers get the best possible rates and the most reliable service.

Paddle is the merchant of record for your transactions: [find out what that means here](https://www.paddle.com/taxes-fraud-compliance).

#### Installments

Some payment method issuers may offer credit installments on eligible one-time purchases, letting customers pay for items over a period of time. This is sometimes called "buy now, pay later" or "pay in 3." For example, PayPal lets customers pay over three or four months.

Credit agreements for installment payment plans are between the customer making a purchase and the payment method issuer. They're not provided by Paddle, and Paddle doesn't determine which customers or purchases are eligible for installments.

When customers pay using installments, Paddle receives the full amount up front from the payment method issuer, and you receive this as part of your payouts as normal. Because the credit agreement is between the customer and payment method issuer, you're not responsible if a customer fails to make payments as part of their installment plan.
