Does Paddle support subscription-based sales models?

The subscription billing model, also known as repeating billing or SaaS, is fully supported by Paddle.

Paddle’s flexible setup allows you to determine billing periods, trials, discounts, pro-ration, and per-use billing, as well as move users between plans and cancel both via the dashboard and our API.

We have a [guide here](https://developer.paddle.com/build/overview) on how to create your first subscription plan, and [documentation for subscribing to the relevant webhook notifications](https://developer.paddle.com/webhooks/overview).
