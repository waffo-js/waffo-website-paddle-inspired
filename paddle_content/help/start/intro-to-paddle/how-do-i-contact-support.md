How do I contact Support?

# I’m an existing Seller

_Get help with using the platform_

You’ll find answers to various questions you may have about Paddle in both our [Help Centre](https://www.paddle.com/help) and [Developer Documentation](https://developer.paddle.com/) by using the _search function_. If you’re unable to find answer, you can get in touch with us by following the information below.

Existing customers can get in touch by emailing our _Customer Support_ team at [sellers@paddle.com](mailto:sellers@paddle.com). Be sure to send an email via an email address linked to your existing Paddle account. This ensures we can identify you quickly and link your request to your account.

Alternatively, existing customers can [sign in to the Paddle dashboard](https://login.paddle.com/) and use the chat widget in the bottom-right of the page to speak to us. If you're unable to see the chat widget, please check that you're [using a supported web browser](https://www.paddle.com/help/start/intro-to-paddle/paddle-dashboard-chat-widget-browser-requirements).
