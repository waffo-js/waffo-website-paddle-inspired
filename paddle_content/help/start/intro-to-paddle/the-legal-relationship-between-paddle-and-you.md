The legal relationship between Paddle and you

As a software developer or content creator, we want you to focus on just that.

For businesses & developers we work with, Paddle is an authorized reseller of their products, as opposed to a ‘payment provider’.

As a result, Paddle typically manages all of the following aspects of a sale:

  * Order processing and payment.
  * VAT/ Sales Tax collection, filing, and payment.
  * Order/billing-related support (invoicing, receipts, lost licenses/delivery issues)
  * Fulfillment & Digital Delivery (typically via download, license key, or webhook notification to provide access to a hosted service)


Because Paddle operates in this way, we carefully monitor the quality of the products we are reselling. We’ll often provide feedback, and help with product development & assist with marketing strategy to ensure developers can build incredible software that customers love, without worrying about the technical intricacies of how they get from a polished product to the devices of users everywhere.

If you have any questions about Paddle as a reseller, don’t hesitate to [reach out to us](https://www.paddle.com/contact), we’re happy to answer any questions you might have. We also have full [Terms & Conditions](https://www.paddle.com/legal/terms) on how the Paddle <> Developer relationship works from a legal and tax perspective.
