Domain Review

We’ll review your website domain(s) to make sure they meet our requirements and that the product(s) being sold meet our [Terms & Conditions](https://www.paddle.com/legal/terms) and are within our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.paddle.com/help/start/intro-to-paddle/what-am-i-not-allowed-to-sell-on-paddle).

Ensure the following information is clearly available across your domain(s):

  * A clear description of your product or service
  * Pricing details or a pricing page (a screenshot is acceptable if not yet available)
  * Key features or deliverables included with the purchase
  * Terms and Conditions, Refund Policy, and Privacy Policy (these must be clearly accessible via navigation on your website)
  * Include the company name or sole proprietor’s brand (legal name preferred for sole proprietors) in the Terms & Conditions
  * Site must be live and secured with an SSL certificate (HTTPS)
  * Custom/enterprise pricing sheet (if applicable)*


*This should be available as a downloadable PDF or document that can be provided to our team on request.

This information may be spread across your main domain and subdomains but must be easy to locate.

Only submit domains that are directly related to the product you’re selling via Paddle. If the domain includes unrelated products not sold through Paddle, it may lead to buyer confusion and a higher risk of chargebacks, which can impact approval.

You should submit each domain and subdomain you plan to launch a checkout from, but only one approved domain is required to move forward with verification.

**Failing to include the required information may result in delays to your domain review.**

  


## **Submitting your website domains for review**

Once you're ready to start verification, head to '[website approval](https://vendors.paddle.com/request-domain-approval)' on the Paddle dashboard. You can find that under 'Checkout' on the left nav bar, or follow the verification prompts on your 'get started' page. 

You can [submit additional domains associated with your website](https://vendors.paddle.com/request-domain-approval) for approval at any time.

  


## FAQs

### How long does the Domain Review take?

Reviewing the domain typically takes 3 business days. However, it may take up to 5 business days if additional information is required.

  


### Do I need to do this?

Yes, all customers using Paddle need to successfully complete website domain review for any domain or subdomain from which they wish to launch a Paddle checkout. This will ensure that you are in full control of who is able to load your Paddle checkout and also ensures that your Paddle checkout remains compliant with industry standards of security and safety.

Be aware that you will only be allowed to sell through the domain(s) that have been approved. For example, if you had ‘domain.com’ approved, but you want to enable Paddle checkouts on a subdomain “mystore.domain.com”, you will need to have that subdomain approved separately.

**This does not apply to the Sandbox environment, which can be used without domain approval for testing.

### What if I’m using a feature of Paddle that does not use domains?

Although the feature you’re using may not be reliant on domains, we do need to know where the product is being sold, so we can ensure that we remain compliant with industry requirements. You can contact our Customer Support team for more information by emailing us at [sellers@paddle.com](mailto:sellers@paddle.com)

  


### Why has my domain been rejected?

You’ll receive an email from our team to provide more information, but typically, rejection reasons fall into these categories:

  1. The products being sold on the website are not in line with our Acceptable Use Policy.
  2. The domain being added was flagged as high risk and potentially does not follow our Terms & Conditions.
  3. Our team has requested more information about your website and we’ve not received a response from you.


If you think we made a mistake with your domain review feel free to contact us. You can do this by replying to the email we’ve sent you.

###   


### What additional documents may be required during domain review?

To complete our review, we may ask for specific documents or details depending on your product type. These may include:

  * **Product ownership** – Confirming whether you’re the original creator (e.g. ebooks, templates, exam materials) or reselling under a valid GPL license.

  * **Reseller agreement** – Documentation proving your right to resell third-party products.

  * **Game-related items** – If you’re offering in-game items (e.g. skins, currency), we may need to confirm that you're the owner and operator of the game.

  * **Test account access** – For some product categories, or subdomains requiring login, we may need a test account to verify functionality.

  * **Mod agreement** – If you’re selling game mods, we may request agreements showing which games and mod types are permitted by the seller.

  * **Processing statement** – A document from your payment processor covering the last 3 months, showing total processing volume, refunds, and chargebacks. If you don’t have this due to being a new business, we’ll take that into account during our review.


  


### Can I test my Paddle checkout without domain approval?

Yes, if you would like to test our checkout, you can do so by using our [sandbox environment](https://sandbox-login.paddle.com/signup), which doesn't require approved domains. Please note that you will need to sign up for a [sandbox account](https://sandbox-login.paddle.com/signup) separately.
