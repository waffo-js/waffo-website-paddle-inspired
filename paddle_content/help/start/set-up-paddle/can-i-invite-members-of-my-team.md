Can I invite members of my team?

You can invite additional members of your team to your Paddle dashboard via the [Team](https://vendors.paddle.com/team) page.

When inviting new members of your team you’ll be asked what function they serve within your organization. This is because we limit dashboard functionality based on user permissions assigned to their role. In the future, any user’s permissions can be changed by an admin in your team, at any time.
