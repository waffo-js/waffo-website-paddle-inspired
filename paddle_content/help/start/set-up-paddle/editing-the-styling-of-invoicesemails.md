Editing the styling of invoices/emails?

Yes, you can customize your _order confirmation_ and _customer invoice_ emails from your [Account Settings Page](https://vendors.paddle.com/account-settings).

![Account Settings Page](https://cdn.kustomerhostedcontent.com/media/5b64d5e964987defc0b2a2de/cc361fa098aa19acf83f34a131a073f8.png)

Here, you will find settings for:

  * **Company Legal Name** : This name will display in the top left of both emails by default
  * **Company Display Name (Optional)** : If this name is specified, it will be displayed in the emails instead of your Company Legal Name
  * **Product Website** : This link will display directly under your company name
  * **Contact Name** : _This is not used for customer emails_ \- this is used for Paddle to get in touch with you
  * **Email** : Unless instructed otherwise, our Buyer Support Team forwards any emails from your buyers with questions about the product to the email address you list in your Account Settings. Please ensure the email address you add here is monitored.


## Company Logo

You can also use your company logo image rather than the company name text. Contact our [Customer Support team](mailto:sellers@paddle.com) to arrange this. Before contacting us, please ensure your company logo image meets the following specifications:

  * **Dimensions** :
    * **Icon-based logo/Logos without text** : Minimum 80x80 Pixels, Maximum 500x500 Pixels. Ensure that the image does not have any spaces surrounding the icon - if there are, please crop this out to ensure that it is sized correctly on our template emails.
    * **Text-based logo/Logos with text** : The logo needs to be placed to the left or right of the name in a single line and not underneath it. Ensure that the image does not have any spaces surrounding the icon and/or text - if there are, please crop this out to ensure that it is sized correctly on our template emails.
  * **Maximum Size** : 500 KB
  * **Image Format** : PNG
