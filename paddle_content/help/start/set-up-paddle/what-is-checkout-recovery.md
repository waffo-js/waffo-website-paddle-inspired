What is checkout recovery?

Checkout recovery involves emailing buyers who abandon their checkout, with the goal of enticing them to complete the purchase.

A checkout is considered abandoned when the buyer has provided email, country and post/zip code, but the transaction is not completed. A checkout recovery email will be triggered either when a checkout has been idle (i.e. the buyer hasn't proceeded to pay for the checkout) or abandoned after 60 minutes.

Checkout recovery is available in Paddle Billing at no additional fee and Paddle Classic for an additional 10% transaction fee. 

**Paddle Billing:**

You will be able to send an email to your customers either with or without a discount and this will be sent to the buyer either when a checkout has been idle (i.e. the buyer hasn't proceeded to pay for the checkout) or abandoned after 60 minutes.

To enable Checkout Recovery on Paddle Billing: 

  1. Head over to checkout settings on your Paddle Billing platform

  2. Select the recovery tab

  3. Enable checkout recovery via the toggle


We have created two templated emails, one with and one without a discount. They have both been designed based on feedback from user testing to ensure they are effective, as well as a compliance review to make sure Paddle is 100% compliant.

**Paddle Classic**

Customers will be sent a maximum of two emails. The first one will be sent after 90 minutes of checkout inactivity, encouraging them to return to their checkout and complete the purchase. A second email is then sent out 7 hours after the first email if they have not completed their purchase since the previous email.

To enable Checkout Recovery on Paddle Classic:

  1. Head over to your recover settings within the ‘Recover’ option of the menu

  2. Enable checkout recovery via the toggle

  3. Optional - enable the discount functionality using the discount toggle and by specifying your chosen discount in the field provided


**Please note** : The same settings are applied to Paddle Billing and Paddle Classic. Therefore if you enable checkout recovery it will be enabled across Paddle Classic and Paddle Billing. You cannot choose to turn it off in one setting. 

Checkout recovery emails can be sent with/without a discount, but buyers who are offered a discount in their recovery email are 10-15% more likely to complete the purchase. 

Customers are required to provide marketing consent during the checkout in order to receive discounted checkout recovery emails. If they do not provide marketing consent, they will receive an email without a discount.
