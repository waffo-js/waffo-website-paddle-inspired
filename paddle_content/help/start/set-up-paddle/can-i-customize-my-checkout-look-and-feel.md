Can I customize my checkout look & feel?

Our checkouts have excellent UX and are industry-leading in their conversion rates. You may notice minor changes to user flow/user interface while working with Paddle, as we actively A/B test the checkout across several variants, iterate to improve conversion further, and help our sellers make more money.

You can make minor changes like adding a brand color to the overlay checkout on the [Checkout Settings page](https://vendors.paddle.com/checkout-settings) under the “Overlay” tab.

If you would like further customizability of the checkout, we recommend that you implement our [inline checkout](https://developer.paddle.com/concepts/sell/branded-integrated-inline-checkout) instead, which allows you to fine-tune far more aspects of the checkout under the "Inline" tab.
