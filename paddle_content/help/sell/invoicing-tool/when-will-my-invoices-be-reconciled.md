When will my invoices be reconciled?

Once a buyer has sent a wire transfer, it should be received by our team and reconciled in your dashboard within 2-3 working days.

If you have enabled your buyers to pay via PayPal or Card, the payment will be reconciled instantly and you will not experience delays.

It is possible for _wire transfer_ payments to be delayed due to the time taken between the buyer initiating the transfer and Paddle reconciling the invoice, bank-to-bank payment delays, or errors in the submitted wire transfer. The most common causes for delays are as follows:

  * Buyer provides incorrect invoice reference* or provides no invoice reference when sending wire transfers
  * Wire transfers sent/received on or around public/bank holidays


*The invoice reference is shown on the invoice sent to the buyer, along with Paddle's bank account information, before payment is made.

While we ask buyers to include the invoice reference when sending wire transfer, we strongly advise reiterating this if you are already in talks with the buyer directly. This will help reduce the risk of delays.

If you have experienced delays or have any questions, please contact us at [sellers@paddle.com](mailto:sellers@paddle.com) or via the chat widget in your dashboard, including your buyer's payment confirmation, and our Customer Support team will be able to help.
