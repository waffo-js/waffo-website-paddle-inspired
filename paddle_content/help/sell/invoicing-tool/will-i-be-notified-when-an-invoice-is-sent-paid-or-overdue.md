Will I be notified when an invoice is sent, paid or overdue?

When an invoice is sent, paid, or becomes overdue, the invoice status in your Paddle Invoicing dashboard will change. In the Paddle dashboard, you can set up alerts to notify you via webhooks or email when an invoice is sent, paid, or overdue.
