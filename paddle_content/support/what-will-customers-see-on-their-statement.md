What will customers see on their statement?

By default, card payments made via the Paddle checkout will use the first 10 characters of your company name which you provided when you joined Paddle e.g. `COMPANYNAM`. This is referenced on the customer’s receipt for the utmost clarity.

You can modify the statement description that will appear on the customer’s statement through the [Checkout Settings page in your Paddle dashboard](https://vendors.paddle.com/checkout-settings). We recommend using a name here that is clear and recognizable to your customers to avoid [disputes & chargebacks](https://www.paddle.com/help/manage/risk-prevention/what-are-disputes).

Your chosen statement description will appear on the customer’s bank/card statement as: `PADDLE.NET* COMPANYNAM`. Your chosen descriptor can only contain uppercase letters, numbers, spaces, and dots (`.`) between 2 to 10 characters long. At least one letter is required. Dots cannot be set as the first or last character in your statement description.

Note that PayPal payments made via the Paddle checkout are not customizable, and will always appear on the customer's bank/card statement as: `PAYPAL *PADDLE.NET`.
