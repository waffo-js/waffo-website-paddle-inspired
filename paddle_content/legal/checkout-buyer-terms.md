## Introduction to the Services

These terms and conditions create a contract (“**Agreement** ”) between you (**"Buyer** ") and Paddle (as defined below) and govern your use of the Services.

Paddle is the Merchant of Record and authorised reseller of the Product for the Supplier, which means that you purchase the Product from Paddle using the Services, but the Product is licensed to you by the Supplier.

**Please read the Agreement carefully. By placing an order with Paddle, you agree to the terms and conditions set out in both this Agreement and the Supplier Agreement.**

**WHERE A PRODUCT IS DIGITAL CONTENT WHICH IS IMMEDIATELY MADE AVAILABLE, BY DOWNLOADING OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRING THE PRODUCT, YOU CONSENT TO IMMEDIATE PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WILL LOSE YOUR RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THIS AGREEMENT ONCE THE DOWNLOAD OR APPLICABLE TRANSMISSION OF THE DIGITAL CONTENT HAS BEGUN.**

If you are a Consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident. Nothing in this Agreement, including the Governing Law clause, affects your rights as a Consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law.

### Definitions and interpretation

### Contract Formation

By completing a Transaction through Paddle Checkout, you make a binding offer to enter into a contract with Paddle, subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Transaction process consists of the following steps:

Step one: you select the desired Product and agree the terms of the Supplier Agreement. 

Step two: your personal data, required for the Transaction and delivery of the Product, is collected by us in accordance with the Privacy section below. 

Final step: you can review all of the information again and, if necessary, correct it before completing the Transaction. You complete the Transaction by clicking on the button stating “order with obligation to pay” or a corresponding unambiguous statement that indicates that placing the order entails an obligation to make a payment. 

Paddle will confirm receipt of the Transaction of the order immediately by sending you the order confirmation. The order confirmation will result in the creation of this Agreement and is acceptance of your offer to purchase the Product.

Your Agreement with Paddle is concluded upon the successful transmission of the Product, subject to the terms of this Agreement.

### Software

Where any Product supplied is, or includes, software (“Software”), the Software is licensed by the relevant Supplier pursuant to the Supplier Agreement included with Software (or other applicable terms associated with non-Software Products, including recurring purchases or billing services) or otherwise agreed between you and the Supplier.

### Payment, taxes and refunds

Paddle will charge your chosen payment method (such as your credit card, debit card, PayPal account or any other methods available) for any paid Transactions, including any applicable taxes according to the tax jurisdiction in which the Transaction is taken place. If you pre-order the Product, you’ll be charged upfront, during which time you can request a refund for whatever reason until the content is delivered, after which the standard refund policy applies.

You agree to receipt of all invoices and receipts in an electronic format, which includes email. Product prices may change at any time. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of the Product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the Product or refund of the price paid, as determined by Paddle. When providing us with your information, you must ensure that it is up-to-date and accurate. Paddle will not be responsible for the event of non-receipt of the Product due to incorrect information being provided by you. To make amendments to your order, please contact us [here](https://paddle.net). We reserve the right to not fulfil and to cancel orders if we’re unable to obtain payment authorisation from the issuer of your payment card.

### Chargebacks

We understand that there may be occasions where you may not recognise or wish to dispute a payment made to Paddle in relation to a Transaction.

Chargeback is a mechanism for your payment card issuer (at their discretion) to reclaim money from a retailer’s bank. This can allow your card issuer to provide you with a refund in a number of circumstances, including:

  * if you do not get the Product you paid for;
  * if you are charged the wrong amount, or charged twice by mistake;
  * if the payment was made fraudulently.


You agree to contact Paddle prior to raising a request for a chargeback or any dispute with your bank or card issuer in relation to any Transaction.

We recognise that chargebacks can happen for a variety of reasons. However, if you make a card payment through Paddle, and later dispute a legitimate charge by raising a chargeback without merit or legitimate reason (as determined at our sole discretion), whether fraudulently or otherwise, then we reserve the right to prohibit you from using our Services by providing compelling evidence to refute your invalid chargeback request.

### Termination and suspension of Services

If you fail, or Paddle suspects that you have failed, to comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement, Paddle may, without notice to you: (i) terminate this Agreement, and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination; and/or (ii) terminate your license to the Product; and/or (iii) preclude your access to the Services. Paddle further reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (or any part thereof) at any time with or without notice to you, and Paddle will not be liable to you or to any third party should it exercise such rights. To the extent possible, Paddle will warn you in advance of any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service. Termination of the Service will not affect any rights accrued thereunder or the Product that you have already acquired.

Where Paddle suspects that fraudulent activities are being conducted by you, we have the right to cancel and block your usage of our Services without notice. Paddle may also liaise with relevant authorities for law enforcement and financial crime prevention reasons and pass your details on to authorities should evidence be found confirming malicious or fraudulent or other criminal activity.

### Consumer Right to Cancel

If you are a Consumer and unless the below exception applies, you have the right to cancel this Agreement and return the Product within 14 days without giving any reason. The cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day after completion of the Transaction. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient that you send us your communication concerning your exercise of the cancellation right before the expiration of the 14 day period.

To cancel your order, you must inform Paddle of your decision. To ensure immediate processing, please do so by contacting us [here](https://paddle.net). Please note that in respect of subscription services your right to cancel is only present following the initial subscription and not upon each automatic renewal.

You also have the right to inform us using the model cancellation form below or by making any other clear, unambiguous statement through our available communication channels. If you use our [“Contact Us” form online](https://paddle.net), we will communicate acknowledgment of receipt of your cancellation request to you without delay.

_To Paddle, Buyer Support Team_

 _I hereby give notice that I cancel my contract of sale of the following Products_

_Address of consumer(s),_

#### Effect of Cancellation

If you cancel this Agreement as permitted above, we will reimburse to you all payments received from you.

We will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel this Agreement.

We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction and you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.

#### Exception to the Right to Cancel

Your right as a Consumer to cancel your order does not apply to the supply of Digital Content that you have started to download, stream or otherwise acquire and to Products which you have had the benefit of.

### Refund Policy

Refunds are provided at the sole discretion of Paddle and on a case-by-case basis and may be refused. Paddle will refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behaviour that entitles Paddle to counterclaim the refund.

This does not affect your rights as a Consumer in relation to Products which are not as described, faulty or not fit for purpose.

### Payment by wire transfer 

It’s your responsibility to provide us with the correct payment details (your unique bank transfer reference number), Company VAT / sales tax code and order information to avoid delays in your order fulfilment, as we may be unable to reconcile or refund such transactions. Orders, where payments are made via wire transfer, are not protected under the CCA (Consumer Credit Act) and are therefore not eligible for a refund. However, in cases where the transaction amount, including sales tax or where the sales tax refund is above $ / £ / €100, you may be entitled to a refund including the sales tax you paid, at Paddle’s discretion.

### Indirect Sales Tax refund policy

If you’ve been charged sales tax on your purchase and are registered for sales tax in the country of purchase, you may be entitled to a refund of the sales tax amount if permitted by the laws applicable in such country. Sales taxes include VAT, GST, Consumption Tax and others as applicable from time to time. For wire transfers, please refer to the Wire Transfer section above for more information regarding eligibility of sales tax refunds.

You must contact Paddle within 60 days after completing the purchase to be eligible for a sales tax refund. This refund will only be processed upon the provision of a valid sales tax code for your country.

All refund requests received after 60 days from the date of the Transaction will not be processed.

### Subscriptions

The Services may allow you to purchase access to Product on a subscription basis (“Paid Subscriptions”). Paid Subscriptions automatically renew until cancelled. We’ll notify you if the price of a Paid Subscription increases and, if required, seek your consent to continue. You’ll be charged between 00:00 and 01:00 (UTC) on the day the Paid Subscription period renews. If you wish to cancel your subscription, please contact us [here](https://paddle.net) at least 48 hours before the end of the current billing period. Please make sure you provide your order number and the email address used to purchase the Product. Your cancellation will take effect at the next payment date. There are no refunds on unused subscription periods.

Certain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial before charging you. If you decide to unsubscribe from a Paid Subscription before we start charging your payment method, you must cancel the subscription before the expiration of the trial period by contacting us [here](https://paddle.net). If we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), and you have not cancelled your Paid Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. We reserve the right to cancel your Paid Subscription if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew your subscription.

### Contract Changes

Paddle reserves the right at any time to modify this Agreement and to add new or additional terms or conditions on your use of the Services. Such modifications and additional terms and conditions will be communicated to you and if accepted, will be effective immediately and will be incorporated into this Agreement and will apply to the purchase of any further Products through the Services. In the event you refuse to accept such changes, Paddle will have the right to terminate the Agreement.

### Transfer to Supplier

This Agreement and Paddle’s rights and obligations under this Agreement will be transferred automatically to the Supplier upon receipt of a written notice from the Supplier requesting the transfer. In such circumstances:

  * The Supplier agrees to be bound by this Agreement in every way as if it were the original party to it in place of Paddle
  * You will perform the Agreement and be bound by its terms in every way as if the Supplier were the original party to it in place of Paddle.
