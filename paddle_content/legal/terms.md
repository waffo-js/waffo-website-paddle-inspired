Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the services are provided "as-is" and without warranties of any kind, including, without limitation, any warranties of performance or implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement. Further, Paddle does not make, and has not made, any representation or warranty that the Services are accurate, complete, reliable, current, error-free, or virus-free or that the operation of the Services will be uninterrupted. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of an implied warranty, so this disclaimer may not apply to you.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Paddle, its partners, service providers, affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents be liable to the other party for any special, incidental, indirect, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages, whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, which may arise out of or in connection with this Agreement, regardless of whether either party has been apprised of the possibility or likelihood of such damages occurring, or whether claims are based or remedies are sought in contract or tort otherwise. 

12.3. Paddle's aggregate liability, howsoever arising and whether in tort (including for negligence or breach of statutory duty), contract, misrepresentation, restitution or otherwise, under the Agreement shall not exceed the sum of the Paddle Discounts applied to Transactions in the 6-month period immediately preceding that date of the event or circumstance giving rise to the liability.

12.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party limits its liability in respect of (i) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; (ii) death or personal injury caused by negligence; (iii) a breach of any obligations implied by section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 or section 2 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982; or (iv) any matter for which it would be unlawful for the parties to exclude liability.

13.2.
