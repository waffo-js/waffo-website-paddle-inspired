## Drive revenue outside the walled garden

With new [ruling forcing Apple to allow external payment links in iOS apps](https://www.paddle.com/blog/apple-vs-epic-app-store-changes), developers finally have real alternatives to closed app store ecosystems. The opportunity to reach more users and keep more revenue is no longer hypothetical, it’s here.

But selling outside the app store still comes with complexity: payments, currency conversions, refunds, chargebacks, sales tax, and compliance all need to be handled at scale.

Our [Paddle Studios](https://www.paddle.com/studios) team breaks it down for you.

## Sell your app on the web with Paddle

As a Merchant of Record, Paddle acts as the middleman between you and your customer when you sell outside the app stores on the web. We operate just like the app stores but for your web sales.

We take on all the risks and responsibilities associated with managing payments, honoring refunds and chargebacks, fraud protection and sales tax.

With Apple now allowing developers to link out to external payments from iOS apps, there’s a new opportunity to drive mobile revenue through your own web store—without the app store fees. Paddle helps you do this in a way that’s compliant, seamless, and developer-friendly.

If you're exploring how to scale mobile revenue beyond the app stores, [our mobile app monetization guide](https://www.paddle.com/resources/mobile-app-monetization-guide) breaks down the strategies top apps are using. And if you're ready to build, [our iOS Checkout docs](https://developer.paddle.com/build/launch-ios-app-checkout) walk you through the setup step-by-step.
