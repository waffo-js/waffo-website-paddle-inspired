## The fragmented payments challenge

SaaS companies often build their payments infrastructure piece by piece (payments, subscriptions, tax, invoicing, reporting, etc), responding to the latest growth challenges with a new component. But they later find their growth restricted by a fragmented stack, poor integrations, and manual processes. 

What’s more, cross-platform data is unreliable, the overall payment stack gets very expensive, and you have less time to build your product. The result? Anxious investors and frustrated customers.

## 10 years’ SaaS experience

Building a payment infrastructure is more than just building a checkout and plugging in a payment processor. It’s essentially like building a new product.

The checkout is just the beginning. You need to integrate payment gateways, different payment methods, subscription models and all sources of users. You need to, create receipts, invoices and the charges or billing logic. You need to update tax rates, tax calculations and transaction data for reporting. It’s a frightening to-do list that only increases as you scale. 

But fear not. We’ve spent 10 years building all of this, so you don’t have to.
