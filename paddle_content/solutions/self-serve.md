Introduce self-serve

# Open the floodgates with PLG

Introducing and scaling a product-led model can be lucrative, but it also requires a completely new sales motion.

## The downmarket challenge

Opening a product-led channel is a different ball game to chasing enterprise sales. You need to:

  * Create an optimized checkout and automate your subscription logic. 
  * Handle global sales taxes and make changes to your product and commercial teams. 
  * Implement self-serve alongside your existing outbound sales structure. 


What’s more, hybrid billing can lead to siloed data and processes, which makes reporting on revenue even more challenging.
