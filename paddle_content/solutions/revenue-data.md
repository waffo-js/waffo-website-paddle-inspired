Reconcile revenue data

# Reconcile self-serve and sales-assisted revenue streams

Combining inbound self-serve with a sales-assisted motion is the biggest trend in SaaS, but it also doubles go-to-market complexity.

## The hybrid sales challenge

Many high-growth B2B SaaS companies are pursuing hybrid strategies, using payment processors and subscription tools for self-serve, and CRMs and financial tools for their sales teams. 

But this involves building two fragmented payment stacks and wasting time on manual billing and reporting, and it leaves revenue data disconnected and inaccurate.

## Globally tax compliant for invoices and checkouts

As a merchant of record, we’re registered to collect and remit global sales taxes on your behalf. As a result, your checkouts and invoices are tax compliant globally by default.

Switching to Paddle meant that we could remove some of the other tools we were using to manage billing. This, along with the time we are saving our development, finance and legal teams, means we’ve cut billing costs by 15%.
