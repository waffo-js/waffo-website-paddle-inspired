## Due diligence can be hard work

A convoluted payments stack is a big red flag to smart investors. They want to see you’re on top of your payment flows, tax liabilities, revenue recognition, and reporting.

Trying to assemble your own payments infrastructure triggers understandable concerns about the reliability of your numbers and your ability to grow quickly as you go international, move upmarket, or roll out new products.
