# Seize your global opportunity

Software companies are born global by default. From day one, this creates huge opportunities, and also huge challenges.

## The international challenge

For SaaS companies, payments complexity can be crippling even when you’re doing business in a single country. Add another, and you face integrating new payment platforms, supporting new currencies and languages, and complying with new tax regimes. Then there are the reporting and performance challenges.

## Globally tax compliant

The biggest compliance risk when selling in different markets is sales tax.

It’s tough to manage, but even tougher if you get it wrong. With Paddle, you don’t need to stay on top of the ever-changing sales tax regulations on software because we deal with all your sales tax liability.

![be globally tax compliant](https://images.prismic.io/paddle/28e9508f-c636-408f-a944-69ad08fefe30_platform-tax-full-01+%282%29.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=3840)

With Paddle, we can reach a wider global audience and localize their experience more easily.
