I have more questions. How can I get in touch?

For any additional questions, please reach us at [launchpad@paddle.com](mailto:launchpad@paddle.com)

How long does the program last? What happens after the program ends?

The program lasts 5 weeks. Upon graduation, participants become alumni and continue to engage and share resources on Slack. Alumni also benefit from periodic Office Hours, providing ongoing mentorship and support long after the program ends.

Is there any funding provided as part of the program?

No, this is a non-dilutive program (which means we don’t offer financing and funding in exchange for equity in your company). There is however a cash prize for the Demo Day winner in each cohort.

What is the time commitment required from founders during the program?

The power of this program is in the community, and like any community you get back what you put in. Ideally, we recommend you spend 2-5 hours per week. 

Generally, some founders will lean into structured programming, speakers and workshops, while others will focus primarily on meeting peers/founders to trade ideas and tips. There's no "right" version - do whatever suits you best :)
