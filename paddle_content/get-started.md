Switching to Paddle meant that we could remove some of the other tools we were using to manage billing. This, along with the time we are saving our development, finance, and legal teams, means we’ve cut billing costs by 15%.

Paddle has really helped us scale. We can process more and more transactions without having to worry about sales tax implications or creating more admin for the team.

We have a lot more control over the checkout experience now. It’s on brand and cohesive with our website, which really increases customer trust in the experience.

Paddle has been an integral part of our enterprise journey, providing support with billing and licensing deals that has helped increase our global revenue growth.

With Paddle, we can reach a wider global audience and localize their experience more easily. It helps us respond to new opportunities as we find them, rather than spending time implementing new tools and processes.

Paddle has been a trusted partner in helping Tower switch to a SaaS billing model and target larger enterprise accounts successfully.

I don’t have to spend time fixing issues in Paddle, It just works. This gives me back at least 3-4 hours a week which I can then spend on developing our product.
