Over the past year, we’ve seen a big shift in the way that SaaS, app, and AI companies operate. It’s never been faster to build, and distribution is becoming the real challenge.

For over 13 years, Paddle has served as the [Merchant of Record](https://www.paddle.com/blog/what-is-merchant-of-record) for leading software companies - navigating every major industry shift and regulatory change along the way. We’ve spent 2025 building the tools to remove friction and help you grow as fast as your competitors. Earlier this year, we expanded our payment methods, improved our invoices and customer portal, and launched early access for Paddle Classic to Billing migrations. 

See how Paddle’s latest updates are helping sellers get their products into the hands of customers everywhere.

**Here’s what we’ve been working on:**

  * Giving your customers more ways to pay with **additional local payment methods** , such as BLIK, MB Way, Pix, UPI and more, to increase your conversions in even more regions worldwide.
  * **Unifying the Paddle platform** by bringing billing, payments, tax, and reporting together and improving our developer experience to reduce your operational complexity.
  * Reducing payment friction with **checkout enhancements** including one-click payments, express checkouts, and cardless trials to simplify checkouts and give buyers more flexibility.


**Watch the full event here or scroll down for the highlights.**

## Industry trends

Before we dive in, it’s important to understand the context of how the wider market shapes the way we work.

  * **AI is enabling leaner teams and rapid product innovation** \- from faster testing, iteration, and scaling, to launching new AI products, companies are no longer focusing on administration, but differentiation. 
  * **Distribution is the battleground** \- with building becoming faster, now the real battle isn’t creating a great product, it’s getting your product into the hands of customers everywhere.
  * **Global digital growth is accelerating** \- more than just acquisition, distribution, retention, and monetisation are leading growth across every channel and region.
  * **Tax compliance complexity is rising fast** \- a Merchant of Record (MoR) infrastructure is becoming essential as customers begin to expect built-in compliance from day one.


## Better insights to scale faster

### **Updated Dashboard experience**

We’ve rebuilt the Paddle dashboard with a refreshed interface that’s more consistent, accessible, and intuitive, so you can focus on running your business, not finding your way around.

With smoother navigation and refreshed components, we now have a better foundation for future analytics and improvements based on your feedback.

### **Reporting foundations**

Reporting is where complexity becomes clarity, and giving you data that is useful, actionable, and empowering is what separates Paddle from other MoRs and PSPs.

In 2025, we built a new Reporting team to bring you faster and better insights:

  * A new **Overview page** that gives you a snapshot of your business performance in a glance. Surfacing key KPIs in one view - MRR, active subscribers, checkout conversion, payment acceptance - so you can instantly see what’s working. This is rolling out in stages between now and January.
  * Finance teams can now pull the **Payout Reconciliation report** directly from the dashboard, to link payouts back to buyer transactions and validate revenue and fees instantly.


And in Q1 2026, you can expect the **Checkout report** which will help you understand performance across your entire funnel and the **Subscriptions report** to track subscribers and churn trends.

### **Integrated cancellations**

Paddle customers saved millions in involuntary churn in 2025 using [Retain](https://www.paddle.com/retain), but we’ve been focused on tackling voluntary churn too.

In early 2026 you’ll be able to set up and configure cancellation flows directly in the Billing dashboard. With built-in salvage actions like pause, downgrade, discount, or contact support, you can reduce churn, improve recovery, and have more control in one place.

## Simplified global growth

### Localized payment methods

Over 60% of our customers who added additional payment options saw a 27% GMV uplift. Even a single local payment method could increase conversion by 5.5%, so expanding our payment methods was a huge focus for Paddle in 2025.

We’ve added several new payment methods across the globe:

  * Across Europe, [**BLIK**](https://developer.paddle.com/concepts/payment-methods/blik) and [**MB Way**](https://developer.paddle.com/concepts/payment-methods/mb-way) are now live for Billing customers.
  * In LATAM, [**Pix**](https://developer.paddle.com/concepts/payment-methods/pix) is available, meaning faster and easier access for customers in Brazil.
  * In APAC, Korean payment methods are live, with recurring support for [**Kakao Pay**](https://developer.paddle.com/concepts/payment-methods/korean/kakaopay) and [**Naver Pay**](https://developer.paddle.com/concepts/payment-methods/korean/naver-pay) coming later this year. And [**UPI** ](https://developer.paddle.com/concepts/payment-methods/upi)is rolling out to an early access cohort for your customers in India.


### Automatic tax by location

How pricing is displayed varies by country, with some expecting it to be included in the price and others expecting to see it at checkout. It’s a small thing, but transparent fees can go a long way in building trust. That’s why we’ve launched **automatic tax display by buyer location** , to stop the 48% of shoppers who abandon their cart when they see extra costs from leaving.

To help you grow globally while feeling local, Paddle now automatically switches between **tax-inclusive and tax-exclusive pricing** depending on the buyer’s country, giving you one less thing to manage.

### Checkout enhancements to optimize conversion

Simplifying your checkout can lift conversion rates by up to 35%. Your checkout experience is your biggest revenue lever, and our latest releases make it faster, leaner, and more flexible:

  * **Upsell Checkout** \- When deployed successfully, upsells can increase average order value by up to 30%. Our new [Upsell Checkout](https://developer.paddle.com/build/checkout/upsell-checkout) means customers can pay by card, PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay with one-click for both one-time and subscription products, reducing the checkout footprint by 60%. This cuts cognitive load for buyers and helps them proceed quickly without feeling overloaded, helping you convert more without adding steps.
  * **Apple Pay Express Checkout** \- We’ve seen so many of you adopt the 1-click Apple Pay experience that we’re working on an Apple Pay Express Checkout that introduces a minimal, conversion-optimized flow using wallet credentials to remove unnecessary options and the need to enter extra details. Early access opens in Q4 - [sign up to register your interest](https://paddlecom.typeform.com/to/tBe1ZzoG) and be among the first to try.
  * **Paid trials** \- In Q1 2026, we’ll be launching paid trials for general access, allowing your customers to define a trial price and duration directly within a product, alongside the recurring amount, all linked to one price ID. An effortless way to offer a lower-cost entry point, paid trials let buyers test your product while keeping real revenue flowing from day one.
  * **Cardless trials** \- On average, free trials convert at around 18%, while paid trials convert at closer to 45%. By removing friction with cardless trials, customers can see the value first and only enter payment details they’re ready to commit, while you can use Paddle’s webhooks to track and prompt buyers as their trial progresses. This is now live in Developer Preview for customers on our Early Access program.


### **Flexible payouts**

We know that the speed at which you can access your revenue directly impacts how fast you can scale.

This fall we’re introducing **Weekly Payouts** , faster access to your revenue, more flexibility to invest in growth, and better control over your cash flow. [Early access is open now](https://paddlecom.typeform.com/to/tBe1ZzoG), with rollout to selected customers over the next few months.

## Scale without complexity

### Improved developer experience

Paddle’s platform has always been built for developers - and this update strengthens that foundation with better tooling, automation, and security. We’re sharing improvements to API key management, upgrades to our MCP server, and exciting progress on our self-serve integrations project.

We’re rolling out **API Key Secret Scanning** , a safeguard designed to automatically detect exposed or misused Paddle API keys in public sources, and notify you immediately. Right now, it’s limited to GitHub repositories, but we’re already exploring support for additional providers.

Our **MCP server** has upgraded from 8 to 80+ tools. AI agents can now access the entire suite of Paddle API functionality, unlocking them to do anything and everything in Paddle as part of your agentic workflows. As AI becomes an integral part of how software is built, this type of intelligent tooling will help you integrate with confidence, combining flexibility and security.

And looking ahead to early 2026, we’re launching the **first iteration of a self-serve integrations**. Like a developer-friendly marketplace where you can discover the apps and tools to help you solve your toughest business challenges, our self-serve integrations will give you plug-and-play ways to connect Paddle with your stack.

### Paddle Classic to Paddle Billing migrations

For teams ready to move to Paddle Billing, the transition just got easier. The new **in-dashboard migration tool** is now in early access, allowing you to move subscribers from Classic to Billing with confidence and ease, with no impact on your buyers. Several customers have already completed successful migrations with positive feedback. This tool will be available for general access in early 2026, but you can [migrate now using our dev docs](https://developer.paddle.com/migrate/overview).

Here are some Billing features delivering real value to our customers:

  * Our new **one-page checkout** provides a faster, cleaner purchase experience to boost conversions and reduce drop-off.
  * Your customers can now **save their preferred payment methods** , making repeat purchases faster and frictionless.
  * The **Customer Portal** allows your customers to view their transaction history, download receipts, and update payment details, cutting down on support tickets and improving customer satisfaction.
  * You can **set country-specific pricing** based on local willingness to pay - helping you optimize revenue in key markets like Germany or Spain and drive profitability globally.
  * Billing allows you to **recover abandoned checkouts at no cost**. Just enable recovery emails in Checkout Settings to convert high-intent users automatically.


### **Partnering with Paddle**

Partnerships have always been central to extending the value of Paddle and enabling our customers to grow faster. We’ve built an incredible partner ecosystem that spans app and SaaS integration partners, technology platforms, and agencies - from innovators like Vercel, Superwall, and RevenueCat, to global technology leaders like AWS and Google Cloud. 

With the [Apple vs Epic ruling](https://www.paddle.com/blog/apple-vs-epic-app-store-changes) in May changing the game for how app companies monetize, we’ve deepened our collaborations with partners such as **RevenueCat, Adapty, Superwall, Zellify** , and others over the last few months. These partnerships give you more flexibility with managing subscriptions across platforms, improving retention, and optimizing monetization.

In 2026, we’ll continue to strengthen and evolve our partner integrations to make running and growing a mobile app business even more seamless. Interested in partnering with Paddle?
