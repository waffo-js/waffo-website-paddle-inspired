Following our acquisition of ProfitWell in 2022, Price Intelligently was maintained as a standalone brand and business. They serve a unique role in the pricing & monetisation landscape; nobody else provides such rich, data-driven and customer-specific insight.

However, we have come to the conclusion that Paddle is no longer the best home to develop Price Intelligently’s strategic capabilities and support the team’s ambitions. Paddle is focused on a different portion of the market, and is a fintech rather than a consulting business. Divesting Price Intelligently allows Paddle to prioritize our core offerings - Billing, Retain and ProfitWell Metrics - and continue to enhance our customer experience through focused advice and support. It’s important to underline our commitment to Paddle’s market - we will continue to research, publish data-backed content, and help our customers and prospects with monetisation and growth strategies.

After a thorough process, we have reached an agreement with [SBI Growth](https://sbigrowth.com/news/sbi-acquires-price-intelligently-enhancing-pricing-strategy) \- a Go-To-Market Advisory firm offering strategic consulting, advisory and training services - to divest all Price Intelligently assets and business activities, including the Price Intelligently team. On many strategic, operational and talent-related dimensions, I believe SBI will be a wonderful home. SBI provides go-to-market growth consulting engagements - from C-level Advisory through to full scale activation and change management. And home to over 100 consultants, SBI’s scale will create career pathways and learning opportunities for our Price Intelligently team that we simply can’t offer at Paddle. Both SBI and Paddle are committed to ensuring a smooth transition over the coming months and maintaining the high level of service and support that customers of Price Intelligently have come to expect.

Meanwhile, Paddle’s mission remains the same: to create a platform that makes it as easy as possible to run and grow a software business. The transaction will not impact any other tools or software integrated to the Paddle platform as part of the ProfitWell acquisition in 2022.

To support this mission, we were delighted to announce a host of new product innovations at the Fall 2024 Paddle Forward. These included the first release of Customer Portal, an entirely new product to give your customers a better overview of their subscriptions and purchases; enhancements to the checkout process in Paddle Billing, including one-page checkout; and updated Retain cancellation flows that ensure best-in-class customer retention tools that reduce churn and maintain compliance with international regulations.

Paddle and SBI will build a strong go-to-market relationship, so that we can jointly serve any customers who benefit from the combined value. We thank the Price Intelligently team for their contributions to Paddle and wish them the very best moving forward.
