Subscription analytics is at the heart of SaaS growth. You and your team should always know why your business is growing, if your customers are happy and if you’re on par with SaaS competitors. Or not. 

You’re probably thinking, “easier said than done!”. Reporting often involves hours of relentless data transfers and manipulation across multiple payments and billing platforms, especially at the end of the quarter when you’re doing board reports and pitch decks.

But it’s 2022 and it shouldn’t be this hard.

Subscription reporting should be absolutely accurate, in real-time. All in one place. All the time.

## Introducing ProfitWell Metrics by Paddle

Paddle is now fully integrated with ProfitWell Metrics which automatically generates out-of-the-box dashboards and reports on revenue growth, retention, cash flow, unit economics and more.

All from a single platform. All 100% free. 

Keep your finger on the pulse of your subscription analytics with precise and actionable revenue reports, without the headache of manually pulling that report together. No more manual clean-ups and reconciliations to check for mistakes. Your data is automatically analysed in clear dashboards and reports.

## Metrics your business lives by 

Whether you’re doing day-to-day reporting, or putting together monthly results for your team and investors, ProfitWell Metrics makes it easy to pull together the core metrics to your business growth. 

At a single glance, you can view:

## Insights to boost your conversions and slow churn 

Expansion revenue is an important growth lever to pull in your business, particularly in a [market downturn](https://www.paddle.com/blog/expansion-revenue-an-underutilized-growth-lever). 

ProfitWell Metrics’ [customer health scores](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics) and [signals](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics) show you where and how to grow your customers’ spend. Reports help you monitor user engagement to help you see who’s ready to convert or upgrade. You can also nudge active trialing users or target loyal customers for upsell and cross-sell opportunities. 

But your growth means nothing if you are pouring new hard earned revenue into a leaky bucket. ProfitWell Metrics’ retention reporting tools help you stop churn in its tracks, with activity data helping you find and focus on at-risk customers. 

This might help you: 

  * Compare customer activity across plans
  * Set alerts to highlight at-risk relationships
  * Target salvage offers and support
