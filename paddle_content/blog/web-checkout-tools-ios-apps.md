As app developers explore opportunities beyond the App Store's ecosystem following the [recent ruling in the US](https://www.paddle.com/blog/apple-vs-epic-app-store-changes), the need for reliable, compliant external payment solutions has never been greater. 

This ruling presents an enormous opportunity for them to improve their margins with lower transaction fees, gain more control over their billing models and customer relationships, and test out external payments.

But the landscape is likely to change quickly as Apple responds to the ruling, and new rules are set. At the same time, many app developers may not be familiar with the tools, infrastructure, and best practices for accepting payments on the web.  


## Giving developers the tools to capitalize on the ruling

So the Paddle team has been hard at work building a toolkit that allows app developers to quickly set-up, configure, and integrate external web checkouts with their in-app payment flows.

These tools are fully compliant with Apple’s requirements around external checkouts (and will remain compliant even as rules are updated), so you can focus on experimentation without worrying about violating Apple’s T’s & C’s.

They also demonstrate the power of Paddle as a [Merchant of Record (MoR)](https://mor.paddle.com/), which means we take on the responsibilities that the App Store typically handles for app developers, such as chargebacks, disputes, fraud protection, buyer support & global sales tax compliance. These all fall on the app developer when they accept payments externally.

Our web checkout tools are built for app companies of all sizes and needs, with tools prioritizing ease of set-up, customization, or scalability. Check them out below:

  


## Hosted checkouts

### **What this means for developers**

A low-code solution that enables developers to create a secure, web-based checkout directly from their Paddle dashboard. Simply direct users to a Paddle-hosted URL from an app, passing query parameters to specify products and prefill user details. No infrastructure to set up or maintain.

### **What developers can do with this**

Hosted checkouts is the fastest way for an app developer to set up an external web checkout, integrate it with their app, and start accepting payments.

Because it’s configured in the Paddle dashboard and hosted by Paddle, it means app developers don’t need to build or host a checkout on their own servers.

Setup is no-code through the Paddle dashboard, so product, marketing, and RevOps teams can create and manage checkouts.

## In-app checkout starter kit

###   
**What this means for developers**

A customizable template that includes everything you need to build an external checkout hosted on their own domain. Deploy to Vercel in a couple of clicks, customize and configure for your business, then direct users to your checkout from the app.

The kit includes frontend components optimized for performance and flexibility, enabling a branded, seamless payment experience.

### **What developers can do with this**

In-app checkout starter kit balances speed of set-up and functionality for app developers interested in customizing their checkout experience. 

This Next.js based template gives developers a serverless foundation that can be deployed to Vercel in a couple of clicks. Built on the same foundation as Paddle-hosted checkouts, it gives developers the ability to host checkouts on their own domains or subdomains.

It comes with everything needed for a secure, optimized payment flow out of the box, with full access to the code so developers can freely extend. Depending on business needs, add custom analytics, unique branding, or even A/B test different designs.

To keep the Paddle platform safe for everyone and make sure that only you are able to sell your products, domains have to be verified by Paddle. This can be managed from the dashboard and typically takes a couple of days.

## Build your own workflow

For developers looking for deeper customization, we published comprehensive docs on how to integrate Paddle into a modern app stack. Build your own implementation using our libraries, then direct users to your checkout from the app.

### **What developers can do with this**

Custom**** implementations give developers complete control over the purchase workflow, including deeper integration with other systems and support for Paddle features like saved payment methods and the customer portal.

On the frontend, **Paddle.js** is our lightweight JavaScript library that can be used to create payment and subscription billing experiences that are seamlessly integrated with your app. Server-side, we offer SDKs for popular languages that you can install to securely integrate systems with Paddle.

## Order fulfillment with Paddle x RevenueCat

For fulfillment and unlocking purchased content, developers can use the [RevenueCat x Paddle integration ](https://www.paddle.com/revenuecat-integration-beta)to activate in-app entitlements from completed checkouts. RevenueCat automatically grants users entitlements based on how products are mapped to Paddle — no additional steps needed.

For more complex workflows, Paddle provides comprehensive webhooks for the entire purchase lifecycle that deliver real-time notifications to the backend, letting developers instantly run specific fulfillment and entitlement logic.
