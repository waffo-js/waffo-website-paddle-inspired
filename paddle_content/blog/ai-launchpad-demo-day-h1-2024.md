We all know that AI is the future - but which start-ups are the future of AI? 

On 9 July, the finalists of the [Paddle AI Launchpad ](https://bit.ly/4cHnCml)accelerator program took part in a public Demo Day event. From AI-led podcast scanning to AI-enabled data interaction, 10 early- stage AI founders pitched their ground-breaking ideas to our expert judging panel for the $20,000 cash prize.

## What is the Paddle AI Launchpad?

The AI space is increasingly competitive with around 10,000 AI startups [receiving](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-the-number-of-ai-startups-by-country/) over $1.5 million of investment in the last decade. But attracting funding is only one piece of the wider puzzle. AI entrepreneurs not only need to build their innovative AI product, but need support monetizing their AI software to create a sustainable AI business. That’s why Paddle set up the AI Launchpad accelerator: a 6-week program aimed at empowering ambitious AI software founders to build, launch and scale their AI-powered business ideas.   


## How were the 2024 Demo Day finalists chosen? 

Following the success of the inaugural AI Launchpad program in 2023, we received hundreds of applications for the program in the first half of 2024. Of these, we selected 129 promising AI start-ups to take part in the program in May 2024. 

Each participating start-up gained access to tailored guidance and practical insights from industry experts during the program. Then, founders submitted their pitch decks and demos for evaluation by a panel of Launchpad leads, select partners, and Paddle leadership, and the top ten were chosen to pitch their ideas on a public Demo Day on 9 July. 

Each of the finalists would have three minutes to virtually pitch their idea to our judges (and live audience) and three minutes of Q&A from our expert investor-led judging panel which included: 

  * Christian Owens, Founder, [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/)
  * Alex Theuma, General Partner, [BackFuture VC](https://www.backfuture.vc/)
  * Maria Palma, Investor, [Kindred Capital](https://kindredcapital.vc/)
  * Federico Wengi, Partner, [SquareOne VC ](https://squareone.vc/)


## Who were the 10 finalists?

The concept of Demo Day was simple: 10 ground-breaking ideas. 10 start-up founders. One $20,000 cash prize. 

**Hailing from across the globe, the ten finalists included:**

## Who were the winners?

At the end of the virtual session, there wasn’t only one winner - but two. 

**Overall Demo Day Winner: Vanna AI, founded by Zain Hoda**

 _“The Paddle AI Launchpad was instrumental in shaping Vanna's growth strategy. The Masterclasses in the program provided invaluable insights into critical areas like pricing strategy, marketing approaches, and defining our value metrics. Meanwhile, the community created a collaborative environment where we could exchange ideas and receive direct feedback on everything from pitch decks to pricing pages and marketing copy. This comprehensive support has been crucial in refining our business model and go-to-market strategy. I’m very grateful to Paddle for having us as part of this year’s AI Launchpad and Demo Day, and extremely proud to have been awarded this year's prize.”  
\- _Zain Hoda, founder, Vanna AI**

**People’s Choice Award: Podscan, founded by Arvid Kahl**

 _"Come because of the tech, stay for the people. Paddle accomplished something magical with the AI Launchpad cohort: they assembled a group of founders who collaborated and inspired each other while building competing AI products. I learned so much about leadership, setting goals, and product experimentation — lessons that immediately impacted Podscan and its trajectory."  
\- Arvid Kahl, founder, Podscan _
