Software grows - and is growing - at a scale that no tangible products can grow. That’s because SaaS is essentially global as soon as you create the business. 

Sounds dreamy, doesn’t it? Until the realization creeps in that you have to deal with a huge (and we mean, _huge_) variety of tax regulations around the world… oh, and they change all the time too. 

Tax compliance can almost definitely be difficult to get your head around, let alone actually stay on top of as an expanding business. We’ve created a guide on everything you need to know about [SaaS sales tax](https://www.paddle.com/blog/global-sales-taxes-for-software-companies-what-you-need-to-know-to-sell-internationally), but thought we’d keep you up to date with regular updates via our blog. 

Here’s what we’ve got for you this quarter.
