AI is redefining product experiences—and business models. Traditional SaaS pricing is being challenged by usage-based, outcome-driven, and hybrid pricing models. With so many options, how do you decide what and how to charge?

In this SaaS Happy Hour session, join Paddle CIO, Andrew Davies and Tremont Partners partner, Kyle Poyar as they explore how AI is transforming monetization—and what you need to do to not just keep up, but build a valuable, growing business.

This is a conversation, not a long presentation. Attendees will submit questions in advance and during the session, for live answers and workshopping.

They'll cover:

  * The wide range of new models to consider; and current trends
  * A simple decision framework to align your AI pricing with your goals—acquisition, margin, or revenue
  * How to choose the right value metric value-aligned, scalable, and easy to measure
