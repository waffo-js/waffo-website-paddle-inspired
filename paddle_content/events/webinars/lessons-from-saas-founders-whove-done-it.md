## What's this session about:

**What makes one SaaS idea take off while others stall?** Join us for an honest, open conversation with founders who’ve walked the path—from that first _“I need to build this”_ moment to sustainable growth and potential exits. Whether you're bootstrapping or chasing VC, building in private or going full build-in-public, this session dives into what actually matters.  
  
Join Arvid Kahl, CEO and Founder at Podscan, Karthik Puvvada, Senior Founder Relations Manager at Paddle, and Andrew Davies, CMO at Paddle as they discuss:

  * **From idea to validation:** How founders knew it was time to build, it was the right idea, and the surprising ways they validated early traction.
  * **Choosing your path:** Bootstrapping vs venture, stealth vs building in public - how top founders made these calls and what they’d do differently today.
  * **Tactics that moved the needle:** Real growth experiments, pricing strategies, and the tech stacks that powered scale.
  * **Lessons from the trenches:** Navigating the AI disruption, spotting exit potential, and the mindset shifts that only come after years in the game.


**This isn’t a pitch. It’s a founder therapy session disguised as a webinar.**
