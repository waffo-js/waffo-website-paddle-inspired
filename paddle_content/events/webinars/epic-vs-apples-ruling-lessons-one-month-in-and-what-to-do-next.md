## What's this session about:

The app landscape is still shifting dramatically since the latest ruling in the Epic Games Vs Apple ruling last month. 

While major companies like Patreon and Spotify are embracing web payment options, some developers remain cautious about potential App Store implications.

Join Paddle’s VP of Product, Lucas Lovell and Growth Advocate at RevenueCat, David Barnard as they dive into what we have learnt in this post-Apple ruling landscape. 

They will cover: 

  * Key monetization changes from industry leaders
  * Data insights from web payment experiments
  * Quick testing strategies
  * Common concerns about Apple's response 
  * Most importantly, is it really worth it?
