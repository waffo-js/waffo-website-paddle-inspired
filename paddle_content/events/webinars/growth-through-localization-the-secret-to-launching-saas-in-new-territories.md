## What's this session about:

Somewhere along your journey, you may have fully tapped your product’s local addressable market for now. Where do you go next? You expand into new territories. 

A new region means a larger TAM, and exponential new revenue. The global SaaS industry is predicted to reach a total value of $623.3 billion by the year 2023 - why not tap into it?

But expanding into just one territory comes with its own complexities, imagine expanding into multiple territories. To name a few:

  * What languages do you need to be able to operate in? 
  * How will pricing your product differ? 
  * Which currencies do you need to be able to bill in? 
  * Will you need to hire more people locally? 
  * How will you remain tax compliant in each territory? 


Join Director of Product at Paddle, Lucas Lovell and Product Lead at [Lokalise](https://lokalise.com/), Alex Pereverzevs as they look to share their experience and expertise on how you can grow through localization. 

There might even be a way for you to offload the complexities of localization to someone else so you can focus on growth. 

**(Spoiler alert: there is and Lucas and Alex have the answer.)**

Book your seat for this non-to-be-missed chat.
