You've got this great app idea. You create the app and get it out on the app stores. Next challenge: How to get your first 1000 paying users. 

In the first episode of Web Revenue Labs, Paddle's Gavin Dove and App Masters Founder, Steve Young, take you through tactics that will help you build acquisition funnels that convert and retention strategies that create sticky customers. 

They will cover: 

  * Proven playbooks to get your first 1,000 users
  * Web2app tactics that convert better than direct app store links
  * Retention strategies that actually work for new apps
  * Web-based monetisation tools to make your first $1K
  * Mistakes to avoid (and what to do instead)
