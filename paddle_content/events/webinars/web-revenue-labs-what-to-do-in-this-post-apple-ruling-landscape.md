## What's this session about:

In the latest turn in the Epic Games v Apple legal saga, Apple is now required to allow developers to link to external payment options without imposing additional fees or restrictions. 

With the freedom and the complexities of taking payments for your app on the web, the real question is: what to do next?

The Web Revenue Labs is back with this exclusive, one-off episode diving into what it all actually means in practice. 

Paddle’s VP of Product Lucas Lovell teams up with App Marketer of the Year 2024 and CEO of Perceptycs, Nathan Hudson, to answer your burning questions and give practical advice you can execute today.  
  
They will cover: 

  * What do we know now since the ruling was announced?
  * The mechanics of actually diving into this post-ruling landscape with web payments.
  * Real examples of apps that have taken on the new opportunities.
  * How a Merchant of Record (MoR) can help.
  * What experiments could you be running first?
