## What's this session about:

PLG has started to define a go-to-market movement, an approach that is being used at companies large and small, serving small niche businesses and global behemoths.

Adam Schoenfeld (3x SaaS founder) has spent the last 6 months digging into the data in product-led-growth, publishing his findings at [peersignal.org](https://peersignal.org/). **In this webinar, we explore the PLG strategies and frameworks driving growth, and expose a few myths along the way.**

**A few of the topics we will discuss:**

  * The data behind analyzing hundreds of PLG companies
  * Does PLG mean no salespeople?
  * How can startups combine top-down (SLG) and bottom-up (PLG), and how can you find an optimal balance between the two?
  * What's the state of SaaS in 2022
  * How does community-led growth fit in?
