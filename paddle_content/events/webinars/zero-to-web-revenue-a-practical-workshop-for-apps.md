Six months after US App Store rulings opened the door to third-party web payments, top apps have run—and scaled—their first external payment link experiments. 

But what’s actually working? We’re partnering with SuperWall to look into early data and lessons learned from app developers experimenting on their platforms. 

  
Join Paddle’s Gavin Dove and Superwall’s Nick Godwin, Product & Growth, in a tactical and data-rich session that will leave you with best practices, lessons and tools to run your own experiments. 

  
You’ll learn: 

  * The clear use cases, triggers, and ROI thresholds for web monetization
  * How to choose and when to mix models
  * The anatomy of a good web experiment
  * Proven flows from high-growth apps
  * The mistakes that stall web monetization
  * The conversion and payback targets to aim for


Save your spot.
