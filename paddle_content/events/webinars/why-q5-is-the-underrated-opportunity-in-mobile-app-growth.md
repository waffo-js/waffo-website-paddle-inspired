The “hidden” fifth quarter is when ad costs drop, user intent spikes, and competition thins out — creating a rare window of opportunity for app growth.

For app developers, Q5 delivers Q4-level user intent at discounted ad prices, with users who are more likely to stay and spend over time.  


So how do you make the most of it?  


Top apps use web monetization to bypass App Store fees, fix attribution, and reach 85% more users.

Join Paddle’s Lucas Lovell and RevenueCat’s Ed Shelley as they break down what’s working (and what’s not) — plus how to use external payments to capture intent and drive growth this Q5 season.
