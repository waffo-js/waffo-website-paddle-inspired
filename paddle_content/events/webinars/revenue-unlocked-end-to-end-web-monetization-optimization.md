Your website isn’t just a marketing tool—it’s a powerful engine for monetization. The most successful apps don’t just convert traffic; they guide users through a high-converting journey from first visit to long-term subscription.

In the fourth Web Revenue Labs episode, join Paddle's VP of Product, Lucas Lovell and growth advisor and consultant, Daphne Tideman for a tactical session on web funnel optimization. We’ll unpack what it really takes to optimize your entire web-to-app funnel for monetization—from first touch to loyal user.

They'll cover how to:

  * Identify your highest-LTV users and what sets them apart
  * Optimize your web funnel to attract, engage, and convert those users at scale
  * Design onboarding flows that build long-term habit and increase retention
  * Find new monetization opportunities across the full funnel—not just at the paywall
  * Apply real-world Web2App strategies used by top-performing apps to drive revenue


Whether you’re optimizing for subscriptions, onboarding, or user lifetime value—this session will leave you with clear insights, tested tactics, and examples you can act on immediately.
