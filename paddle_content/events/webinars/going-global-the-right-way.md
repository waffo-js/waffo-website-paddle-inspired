## What's this session about:

SaaS leaders everywhere are quick to fall in love with the possibility of the international markets solving all of their growth problems. And while it’s true that expanding globally unlocks a world of revenue, it also unlocks a world of complexities.   
  
Where companies go wrong is that they fail to truly research and validate their assumptions before going international. The result is a disappointing lack of impact for all the effort they’ve put in.   
  
This is what’s called "Internationalization Theater" – when a company talks a big talk about going international without actually doing any meaningful work to get there.   
  
To avoid these pitfalls and successfully tap into global demand, you need a strategic, approach tailored to each new target country or region. In this webinar, Elena Verna and Andrew Davies will share real-world examples of how to go global the right way.  
  
You'll learn:

  * The 3-tier framework for prioritizing international opportunities.
  * How to structure a regional launch task force that accelerates your entry into new markets.
  * A step-by-step guide to validate assumptions before going live, ensuring your global expansion is rooted in solid ground.
