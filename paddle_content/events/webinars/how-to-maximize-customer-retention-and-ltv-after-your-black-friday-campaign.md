## What's this session about:

Black Friday is an incredible opportunity for SaaS companies to attract new customers through enticing discounts and promotions, but the real challenge begins after the campaign ends. To ensure long-term success, it's critical to focus on reducing churn and increasing the lifetime value (LTV) of the customers acquired during Black Friday.  
  
Join Paddle as we explore key strategies SaaS companies should adopt to turn Black Friday into a lasting success that drives growth well beyond the holiday season.  
  
**We’ll cover:**

  * Managing discounts and pricing post-Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
  * Dealing with transparent pricing.
  * Reinforcing the value proposition.
  * Incentivizing renewals and upsells.
  * Avoiding stale customer bases.
