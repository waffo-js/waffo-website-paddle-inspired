## What's this session about:

Building a great SaaS product is hard. Scaling globally? Even harder when billing gets in the way.  
  
Most SaaS companies start with a simple payments setup. But as they grow, they stack on solutions for buyer support, fraud, chargebacks, and sales tax compliance. Over time, this DIY setup gets messy.  
  
Before you know it, you have a complex, fragile stack that drains resources and blocks scale.  
  
Join Payments Strategist at Gefferie Group, Dwayne Gefferie, William Hand and Danielle Delahunty-James from Paddle as they cover:

  * Why DIY billing will cost you in 2025—and how to spot the signs early.
  * How the problem compounds, the more you grow, and how to future-proof it.
  * What high-growth SaaS companies are doing differently to unlock faster, frictionless global expansion.
