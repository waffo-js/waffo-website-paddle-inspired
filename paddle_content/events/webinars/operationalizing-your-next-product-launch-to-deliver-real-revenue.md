## What's this session about:

Those first few days of launching a new product are crucial. For many software founders or operators, the launch often feels like you could make or break your product’s future in the market. 

Join Paddle and Beamer to learn about the strategies to increase revenue and build lasting customer engagement through effective product launches. By combining subscription management with effective in-product communication and feedback collection, you’ll learn how to operationalize your next product launch to deliver real value.

**Key takeaways from this session:**

  * Match your launch strategy to your company stage: early-stage startups need to focus on product-market fit, while scale-ups should double down on market leadership.
  * Use a tiered approach: not every launch needs a confetti cannon. Prioritize efforts based on impact. 
  * Don’t stop communicating post-launch: in-app messaging and continuous feedback loops can drive higher retention.
