## What's this session about:

Everyone wants growth. But growth brings complexity. Even if you've built a friction-less product-led growth model for your SaaS, every new pricing tier, each new territory, a new customer type brings new headaches.  
  
Over the past 10 years, product-led growth (PLG) has proven to be incredibly effective at generating low-cost customers globally, therefore making PLG businesses international from day one. And most businesses don't stay product-only. It isn't enough to drive contract value, so sales teams are hired to build upmarket.  
  
Your revenue org needs a system that does all of this well, when current tooling is inadequate to fully address these needs. Otherwise the hidden challenges start becoming growth blockers.  
  
Key takeaways:

  * The principles of scaling SaaS PLG
  * Roadblocks to internationalization
  * Practical takeaways to solve for efficient growth
