What do Grammarly, Calm, Headspace, Gamma, Canva, and Notion have in common? They all began as B2C businesses serving individual consumers and prosumers before successfully expanding into B2B businesses serving enterprises.

This SaaS Happy Hour session will dive into the how.

Join Paddle's Gavin Dove, and Elemental Growth's founder and CEO Phil Carter as they explore how consumer-first products are breaking into enterprise markets. Whether you're considering a pivot or expanding your business model, you'll learn what works (and what to avoid) from real-world examples.

They'll cover:

  * Why B2C apps often hit a ceiling—and how B2B can unlock greater scale
  * Understanding why acquisition, retention, and monetization dynamics often favour B2B businesses
  * The dos and don'ts of pivoting or expanding to B2B
  * Tactics to validate and launch your B2B offering
  * Optimizing B2B subscription pricing, packaging, and go-to-market strategies
