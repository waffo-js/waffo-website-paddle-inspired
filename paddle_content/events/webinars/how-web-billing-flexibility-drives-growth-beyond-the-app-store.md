The web funnel advantage for mobile app developers? Way more flexibility when it comes to billing and pricing than the basic subscription models in the app stores. 

In this Web Revenue Labs episode, we explore how web-based billing opens new doors for pricing, packaging, and sustainable growth in mobile-first businesses.

Join Paddle's VP of Product, Lucas Lovell and VP Product, Passion & Director of Product Growth, Aperture, Lea Samrani as they uncover how app developers can use the new-found billing flexibility to test new pricing models, increase conversions, and build for stronger unit economics.   


They'll cover: 

  * Pricing Framing Tactics – Real-world examples of how better framing can drive more purchases
  * Value vs. Cost – How to increase perceived value and reduce price sensitivity using your funnel and product
  * Web-Only Offers – How to create exclusive deals and use CRM to close more customers


Lucas and Lea will also be joined by Erkmen Erakkus, Co-Founder and CEO, Stoikk, who will be sharing his first hand experience as an early mover in the mobile app landscape.
