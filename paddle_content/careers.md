Our culture

## We value everyone that is part of our company, regardless of your role.

We are building a digital-first company that recognizes how, when, and where our teams do their best work and we like to have some fun along the way. 

### Our values

We can realise our wildest dreams, so long as we help enough other people to realise theirs.

We don’t ‘show up to prove’, we ‘show up to improve’. None of us is as smart as all of us.

Simple can be harder than complex: you have to get your thinking clean to make it simple.

Paddle @ Work

## How we work

We’re building a company that recognizes how, when, and where our Paddlers do their best work because we know that’s unique to them. Here are our core philosophies that make this approach work:

Being Digital First impacts how we think, work, and make decisions. Interact digitally, with trust and autonomy

We create opportunities for our Paddlers to connect and collaborate in person by investing in dedicated hub locations.

Company events

## We take breaks and have fun together

Whether it's a company retreat or happy hour, we know how to have some fun. We work hard at making events inclusive for the entire team and who knows? You might even star in one of our next videos!
