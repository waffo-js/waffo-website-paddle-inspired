# Tax Break | The UK

Take a tax break to The U.K. to learn about the longest tax code in the world.

  * Notes
  * Transcription


#### Overview:

Avoid a 7-year UK prison sentence by thoroughly understanding the country's complex 17,000-page tax code. Navigating software sales taxes can be a daunting task, particularly when every country has a completely different set of rules and regulations.

#### Takeaways:

  * **The UK has the longest tax code in the world:** The UK's tax code is extremely complicated. At 17,000 pages it requires a ton of time and attention to understand, and if you're selling software in the UK, it's important to wrap your head around these extremely complicated measures.
  * **You can face 7 years in prison for violations:** If you don't properly report your taxes you can face up to 7 years in prison and an unlimited fine.
  * **If you make 85k in sales you need to pay attention:** Any business with over 85k in sales needs to comply with this 1.1 million word code and wait up to 4-6 weeks to get their VAT number. And for those dealing with software - the lines between what’s taxable and what’s non-taxable can get blurred. For example - software downloads and digital downloads are taxable but e-books can be sold tax free.


#### History

Taxes in the UK have been complicated since as far back as the 12th century, with various taxes levied for Crusades, hearths, and tea, among other things. The introduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT) in the 20th century added another layer of complexity to an already intricate taxation system.

#### Modern-Tax Situation

Today, the UK tax code holds the title of the world's longest, now 9 times lengthier than all the Harry Potter books combined. Any business generating over £85k in sales must adhere to this 1.1 million-word code and patiently wait 4-6 weeks to receive their VAT number. For those engaged in software sales, distinguishing between what's taxable and what's non-taxable can prove to be quite a challenge. For instance, software downloads and digital downloads are subject to tax, whereas e-books can be sold tax-free. This creates a confusing landscape for businesses to navigate.

#### Conclusion

Proper tax reporting is of utmost importance in order to avoid severe consequences, such as a 7-year prison sentence and unlimited fines for tax fraud in the UK. It is crucial for businesses, particularly those involved in software sales, to familiarize themselves with the UK tax code and ensure full compliance to prevent any legal and financial repercussions.

You don’t want to spend 7 years in a UK prison do you? Just read the UKs 17,000 page tax code and you’ll be, as the British say, Ace. When selling software, taxes can be agonizing…especially when every country has a completely different set of rules. 

Today we’re taking a trip across the pond to the UK. Taxes have been complicated in England since the 12th century

Taxes for the Crusades, Hearths and of course, Tea. And nowadays things aren’t much different. In the 20th Century the UK introduced VAT, and things got a little more complicated. The UK tax code is the longest in the world, now 9 times longer than all the Harry Potter books combined. And any business with over 85k in sales needs to comply with this 1.1 million word code and wait up to 4-6 weeks to get their VAT number.

And for those dealing with software - the lines between what’s taxable and what’s non-taxable can get blurred. For example - software downloads and digital downloads are taxable but e-books can be sold tax free. If these taxes aren’t reported properly - that’s where the agony gets really spicy. Although you can’t be tarred and feathered anymore - in England you can face up to 7 years and an unlimited fine for tax fraud.
