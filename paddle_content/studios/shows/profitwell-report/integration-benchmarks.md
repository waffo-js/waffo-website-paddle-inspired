#### Main Takeaways:

  * Products with at least one integration have 10-15% higher retention.
  * Willingness to pay (WTP) has decreased 70% over the past 5 years. 
  * Core products with at least one integration have 10-30% higher WTP. 


Integrating various applications into a single platform is crucial for enhancing user retention and maximizing product value. A special thanks to Wade Foster of Zapier for asking the question. Responding to Wade's inquiry, this article delves into how integrations impact customer retention and willingness to pay, underpinned by comprehensive industry data.

#### Customer Retention With Integrations

Integrations in SaaS products have proven to be more than just a luxury; they are a necessity that significantly impacts [**customer retention**](https://www.paddle.com/studios/shows/presents/net-dollar-retention). Data gathered from over half a million software users shows that customers with even one integration exhibit a 10% better retention rate than those without. This improvement in retention continues to rise, reaching an increase of 3 to 7% as the number of integrations climbs to four or more.

#### The Market is Dropping Out Beneath Us

Despite the clear benefits of integrations on retention, the market's [**willingness to pay**](https://www.paddle.com/resources/willingness-to-pay) for these integrations has seen a stark decline. Over the past few years, the cost associated with implementing integrations has decreased substantially, largely due to the ease of access provided by automation tools like Zapier. This has led to a nearly 70% reduction in the willingness to pay for integrations, signaling a significant shift in how these features are valued within the software industry.

#### Willingness to Pay With Integrations

While the direct costs for integrations may be falling, the value they add to a product is increasing. Data shows that users who incorporate one to three integrations are willing to pay 8 to 13% more for the core software product. This willingness to pay escalates dramatically to over 20% as the number of integrations increases to five or more. The correlation between integrations and increased willingness to pay holds true across all business sizes, from SMBs to large enterprises, underscoring the indirect value that integrations bring to SaaS products.

#### What's Next?

This analysis confirms the crucial role of integrations in the SaaS industry, not just for enhancing product functionality but also for significantly improving customer retention and perceived value. As the software market continues to mature, the strategic importance of integrations is likely to grow even further.

00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,660

You've got the questions

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,360

Each week, we dive deep on benchmarks

of the subscription economy that

3

00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,475

you just can't get anywhere

4

00:00:10,475 --> 00:00:10,875

else.

5

00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,975

This is the ProfitWell Report.

6

00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:17,890

Hey, Patrick. Quick question.

7

00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,730

Do you know how

integrations affect people's retention of

8

00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,490

the SaaS products they use?

9

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,850

Let me know.

10

00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,035

Awesome. Awesome question, Wade.

11

00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:28,795

Integrations used

to be a luxury.

12

00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,515

The simple software we used

was kind of like the bread and

13

00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:32,635

water of functionality.

14

00:00:32,635 --> 00:00:35,035

So bringing multiple

applications together just kind

15

00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,800

of felt like an indulgence

that we just couldn't afford.

16

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:37,960

Yeah.

17

00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,320

With the explosion of software,

18

00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,960

bringing together all of the

different tools we use to act

19

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,680

as a coordinated unit

isn't just table stakes,

20

00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,005

it's a necessity or

so the data shows us.

21

00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:48,965

To answer Wade's question,

22

00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,525

we looked at the willingness

to pay data from over half a

23

00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:54,700

million software consumers,

and here's what we found.

24

00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,980

As to not vary the lead,

25

00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,700

the number of integrations

your customers use within your

26

00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,725

product has a noticeable

impact on retention.

27

00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:04,925

Customers with even one

integration have ten percent or

28

00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:09,110

better retention on an absolute basis

than those who have no integrations.

29

00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,070

Further, as integrations

increase to four or more,

30

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,950

retention appears to increase

by an additional three to seven

31

00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,575

percent on an

32

00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:19,975

Retention doesn't really tell

the whole story though because

33

00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:22,615

this improvement in retention

isn't coming from people

34

00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,755

upgrading to purchase

integrations.

35

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,640

Instead, willingness to pay

for integrations has actually

36

00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,080

declined by nearly seventy

percent over the past few years

37

00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,040

on the back of integrations

becoming easier and easier to

38

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,385

implement, Thanks in no

small part to Zapier.

39

00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:40,665

Instead, these customers appear to

be getting an increased amount of

40

00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:43,430

value from the products from

which they're integrating.

41

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,030

When measuring

willingness to pay,

42

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,670

those customers who have one to

three integrations are willing

43

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,670

to pay eight to thirteen percent

more for the same core product.

44

00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,695

Those with five or more start

breaking into twenty percent

45

00:01:54,695 --> 00:01:56,615

plus higher willingness to pay.

46

00:01:56,615 --> 00:02:00,055

Perhaps most telling though

is this correlation is consistent

47

00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:05,030

amongst business buyers of all types

from SMBs all the way up to enterprises.

48

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,870

Essentially, integrations indirectly

boost the retention and product

49

00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,085

willingness to pay

of your core product.

50

00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:14,765

After all, if someone starts to

rely on you as basically a platform

51

00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:17,950

through which value flows

through one cohesive unit,

52

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,270

then there's no way they'll

remove your product.

53

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,470

Well, that's all for now.

54

00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,590
