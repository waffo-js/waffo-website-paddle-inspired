# Case Studies, Customer Stories Impact Willingness to Pay

On this episode of ProfitWell Report, we designed a pricing experiment with nearly 30 thousand different subscription consumers across B2B and B2C to learn the impact case studies and customer stories have on willingness to pay.

We live in a fascinating world where even though our advancement as a society has bred the luxury of individuality, we still want to see ourselves in the others that we want to surround ourselves with, because this gives us comfort and trust in the relationships that we undertake.

At least that’s the theory of case studies and customer stories - “Oh I know Sharon. She uses this product? I guess I can use this product, too”. Can we possibly be that primal though? Maybe.

To test this, we asked customers their **[willingness to pay for a product](https://www.paddle.com/resources/willingness-to-pay)** without any customer stories or testimonials. We then asked similar customers on a demographic basis their willingness to pay for the same product, but with different levels of customer stories.

#### Case Studies and Social Proof

In B2B, simply having a customer ribbon or basic testimonials directionally improved willingness to pay. The variation here is pretty wide, but the upward trend indicates roughly a 5% bump in willingness to pay with that little bit of social proof. This trend becomes meaningful when customers were exposed to a mini-case study or a full case study with willingness to pay gains crossing the 10% threshold and trending even as high as 30%.

[![Case Studies Increase B2B Willingness to Pay](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659c961b531ac2845a273b14_CaseStudiesIncreaseB2BWillingnesstoPay.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

B2C showed essentially the same exact trend, with basic social proof coming in a bit lower than B2B and a full case study trending higher than B2B. 

[![B2C Willingness to Pay Jumps with Social Proof](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659c961a531ac2845a273b13_B2CWillingnesstoPayJumpswithSocialProof.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Further, the specificity of the case study seems to have a lot of power. Most case studies you read are very “I love the product. It had a good result” whereas others go into incredible detail. That detail pays off, as in B2B specific case studies increase willingness to pay at double the rate of generalized ones. In B2C specific case studies increase willingness to pay at 5x the rate of generalized ones.

Essentially, if we see ourselves or at least have enough context to understand that a product worked for someone similar to ourselves, we trust that the solution being provided will work and are willing to pay for that outcome. After all, we’ve evolved a lot as humans, but our basic characteristics of trusting the known is still something beautiful when it comes to product marketing.

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,440

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,735 --> 00:00:11,935

Hi, Patrick. Debbie here

from Init Live. I'm curious.

4

00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:14,990

How do case studies or

customer stories impact

5

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,550

We live in a fascinating

world where even though our

6

00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,530

advancement as a society has

bred the luxury of individuality,

7

00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:25,825

we still want to see ourselves

in the others that we want to

8

00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:29,265

surround ourselves with because this

gives us comfort and trust

9

00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:31,965

in the relationships

that we undertake.

10

00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,750

Or at least that's the theory of

case studies and customer stories.

11

00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,990

Oh, I know Susan. She

uses that product.

12

00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,215

I guess I can use

that product too.

13

00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:43,475

Can we possibly be

that primal though?

14

00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:44,375

Maybe.

15

00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,815

To answer Debbie's

great question,

16

00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:48,215

we designed a pricing

experiment with nearly thirty

17

00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,636

thousand different subscription

consumers across b to b and b

18

00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:51,451

to c, and here's what we found.

19

00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,640

To test this, we asked customers

their willingness to pay for a

20

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,860

product without any customer

stories or testimonials.

21

00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:02,315

We then ask similar customers

on a demographic basis,

22

00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:04,875

their willingness to pay for

the same product but with

23

00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,150

different levels of

customer stories.

24

00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,990

In b to b, simply having

a customer ribbon or basic

25

00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,325

testimonials directionally

improved willingness to pay.

26

00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,445

The variation here is pretty

wide but the upward trend

27

00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:20,165

indicates roughly a five

percent bump in willingness to

28

00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:23,230

pay with that little

bit of social proof.

29

00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,870

The trend becomes meaningful

when customers were exposed to

30

00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,990

a mini case study or a full

case study with willingness to

31

00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,950

pay gains crossing the ten

percent threshold and trending

32

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,125

even as high as thirty percent.

33

00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:38,125

B to c showed essentially the

same exact trend with basic

34

00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:41,370

social proof coming in a bit lower

than b to b and a full

35

00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,930

case study trending

higher than b to b.

36

00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,495

Further, the specificity of the case

study seem to have a lot of power.

37

00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:51,855

Most case studies you read are

very, quote, I love the product.

38

00:01:51,855 --> 00:01:53,375

It had a good result.

39

00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:56,470

Whereas others get

into incredible detail.

40

00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,630

The detail pays

off as in b to b,

41

00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,430

specific case studies increase

willingness to pay at double

42

00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,350

the rate of generalized ones.

43

00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,150

In b to c,

44

00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,345

specific case studies increase

willingness to pay at five x

45

00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:13,425

Essentially, if we see ourselves

or at least have enough context to

46

00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:17,090

understand that a product worked

for someone similar to ourselves,

47

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,210

we trust that the solutions

being provided will work and

48

00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,205

are willing to pay

for that outcome.

49

00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:25,725

After all, we've evolved a lot as

humans but our basic characteristics

50

00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:28,685

of trusting the known is still

something beautiful when it

51

00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:30,200

comes to product marketing.

52

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,320

Well, that's all for now.

53

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,200
