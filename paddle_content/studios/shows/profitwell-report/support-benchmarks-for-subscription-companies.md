#### Main Takeaways:

  * Companies perceived to have good support see 12-36% higher WTP. 
  * Retention is ~15% better for companies perceived to have good support.
  * Premium support is becoming more of an expectation over time. 


Time and time again support is looked at as a cost center. Yet, with the customer success movement and phenomenal support software, that view is waning and data suggests you may just have a profit center brewing amongst your support and success teams. 

To answer Nick’s question we looked at the data from over six hundred thousand consumers and nearly five thousand companies. Here’s what we found.

#### Good support drives willingness to pay

First up, to get a direct answer out of the way, good support absolutely increases the [**willingness to pay**](https://www.paddle.com/resources/willingness-to-pay) and retention amongst customers.

We coded respondents perception of a company’s support before measuring their willingness to pay. Those customers who perceived a company’s support positively had between a 12% and 36% higher willingness to pay than the median. Those on the negative perception side had 8 to 16% lower willingness to pay. Neutral respondents were willing to pay about 5-10% less than the median. This indicates that bad support isn’t taking away from willingness to pay as much as good support is driving willingness to pay - padding our profit center argument.

#### Retention also impacted by support

We see a similar relationship on the retention side, as those folks on the positive perception of support have roughly 6 to 15% better net retention and those customers with poor perceptions of support seeing about 8 to 11% worse retention.

#### Premium support is becoming more important to buyers

Digging further, premium support has traditionally scored highly as an add-on - meaning it’s not being valued by everyone, but those individuals who value premium support are willing to pay a good amount for it. Over time though, we’re seeing this view change, where support is still a powerful add-on, but is quickly creeping into being an actual differentiable or core feature - one where the majority of folks actually want premium support and are either just expecting it or are still willing to pay for it.

As more and more features get built and the function aspect of software becomes less differentiable, these formerly intangible pieces of your product - design, brand, and even support - will continue to become more and more important.

00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,100

you've got the questions and we have the

data each week we dive deep on

2

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,980

benchmarks of the subscription economy

that you just can't get anywhere else

3

00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:17,190

this is the profit well report hey

what's up Patrick and my friends at

4

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,539

price intelligently it's Nick from help

scout I got a question for you

5

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,130

you know I'm passionate about customer

service right so I want to know how

6

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,019

great support impacts overall retention

and willingness to pay for a product do

7

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,840

you have any benchmarking data on that I

think it'd be awesome Thanks

8

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,340

oh boy look at that Nick Francis flow

I'm jealous of that hair all right well

9

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,600

time and time again support is looked at

as a cost center you know with the

10

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,710

customer success movement and phenomenal

support software that view is starting

11

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,430

to wane and data suggests you may just

have a profit Center brewing amongst

12

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,480

your support and success teams to answer

Nick's question we looked at the data from

13

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,520

over 600,000 consumers and nearly 5,000

companies and here's what we found

14

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,559

first up to get a direct answer out of

the way good support absolutely appears

15

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,159

to increase the willingness to pay and

retention amongst customers those

16

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,240

customers who perceived a company

support positively had between a 12 and

17

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,170

36 percent higher willingness to pay

than the median those on the negative

18

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,100

side on the other hand had an 8 to 16

percent lower willingness to pay

19

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,640

compared to the median and neutral

respondents were willing to pay about 5

20

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,960

to 10 percent less this indicates that

bad support isn't taking away from

21

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,040

willingness to pay as much as good

support is driving willingness to pay

22

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,790

padding our profit Center argument we

see a similar relationship on the

23

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,659

retention side as those folks on the

positive perception of support have

24

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,860

roughly 6 to 15% better net retention

and those customers with poor perception

25

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,119

of support are seeing about 8 to 11

percent worse retention. Digging further

26

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,560

though premium support has traditionally

scored higher as an add-on meaning it's

27

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,729

not being valued by everyone but those

individuals who do value premium support

28

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,049

are willing to pay more for it over time

though we're seeing this view change

29

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,189

where support is still a powerful add-on

but it's quickly creeping into being an

30

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,420

actual differentiable or core feature

for a product one where the majority of

31

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,790

folks actually want premium support and

are either just expecting

32

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,100

or are still willing to pay more for as

more and more features get built and the

33

00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:22,020

function aspect of software becomes less

differentiable these formerly intangible

34

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,469

pieces of your product things like

design brand and support will continue

35

00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:30,730

to become more and more important to the

value of your company well that's all
