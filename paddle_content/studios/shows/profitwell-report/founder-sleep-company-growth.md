# How Does Founder Sleep Impact Company Growth?

Today on ProfitWell Report, we're answering the question: How does the amount a founder sleeps every night affect company growth? To answer this question, we looked at the data from roughly four hundred subscription companies in the context of their founder’s sleep habits. Here’s what we found.

_**Originally published: June 12, 2019**_

Sleep has been one of the most en vogue topics for founders and just modern humans in general. We’re surrounded by struggle porn that tells us to hustle our faces off, as well as more screens and stimulative calories than our grandparents could dream of in their lifetime. While we’ve learned more and more about what sleep does to the body, we’re forced to wonder how [sleep impacts](https://eachnight.com/blog/entrepreneurial-slumber/) the success of a company.

**From a growth perspective, the results are actually quite interesting.**

But first, if you like this kind of content and want to learn more, **[subscribe to get in the know](https://share.hsforms.com/17xcsifdtRi2xXbSPvncQow2fzi5)** when we release new episodes.

[![Unique SaaS Stories Sent to Your Inbox - Subscribe to Paddle Studios](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/ZmhasJm069VX1o-1_SubscribetoPaddleStudios-v3.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress%3Fauto%3Dcompress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=1920)](https://share.hsforms.com/17xcsifdtRi2xXbSPvncQow2fzi5)

We compared companies with founders who averaged sleep at the medically recommended amount of 7 to 8 hours with the companies who had founders who received less than 7 hours of sleep.

[![Founder & CEO Sleep Patterns Slightly Impact Growth](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659caf6f531ac2845a273b67_PWR-Foundersleep-GRAPH2.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Note that founders of companies who were averaging 4 to 7 hours of sleep did seem to have higher growth rates than their more restful counterparts, but the gains weren’t considerable, topping out at 12% higher on a relative basis at the peak. **Companies helmed by founders receiving less than 4 hours of sleep per night were essentially dead on with the founders who were getting the fully recommended allotment of sleep** , and within the interquartile range were actually trending to grow at a lower rate.

The story gets a bit more interesting when looking at founder happiness in the context of sleep. We measured a Founder NPS or net promoter score, which was essentially looking at how likely founders were to recommend becoming a founder to others.

[![Low sleep impacts Founder and CEO satisfaction](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659caf7c531ac2845a273b68_PWR-FounderSleep-GRAPH1.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

We found that those individuals getting the most sleep had the highest fNPS with a score of 70. They were very closely followed by those founders averaging 4 to 7 hours with a score of 65. Those individuals receiving an average amount of sleep over 4 hours per night had an fNPS that plummeted to 12.

So what’s this mean?

Well, this data is highly qualitative with plenty of lurking variables, so it definitely has limits. **There seems to be an indication that losing some sleep, which you’re bound to do as a founder, does have advantages.** Of course, if you go too far and get even less sleep, your well being is going to hit rock bottom and you’re not going to gain the growth tradeoffs that you think you will by sacrificing your health.

All that being said – you have to keep in mind that building a company is a marathon that appears to be a sprint. You do need to move quickly, but you also need to be doing things that are purpose built for the long term.

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:11,985

Hey, Neil. Matt here,

papa at Bonjoro.

4

00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:14,145

Bit of a different question

for you from down under.

5

00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:16,865

How does founder sleep

affect company growth?

6

00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:17,930

Cheers.

7

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,250

Welcome back, everyone.

8

00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,570

Neil again for the

profitable report.

9

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,930

Sleep has been one of the most

invoked topics for founders and

10

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,025

just modern humans in general.

11

00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:29,745

We're surrounded by struggle porn

that tells us to hustle

12

00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:32,945

our faces off as well as

more screens and stimulative

13

00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:35,840

calories than our grandparents

could dream of in their lifetime.

14

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,880

While we've learned more and more

about what sleep does to the body,

15

00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,560

we're forced to wonder how sleep

impacts the success of a company.

16

00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,825

To answer this question,

17

00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:45,825

we're gonna look at the data

from roughly four hundred

18

00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:49,025

subscription companies in the context

of their founder sleep habits.

19

00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,305

Here's what we found.

20

00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:51,585

From a growth perspective,

21

00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,930

the results are actually

quite interesting.

22

00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,890

We compared companies with

founders who average sleep at

23

00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,770

the medically recommended

amount of seven to eight hours

24

00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,905

with companies who had founders who

received less than seven hours of sleep.

25

00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:06,145

Note that the founders of

companies who were averaging

26

00:01:06,145 --> 00:01:09,185

four to seven hours of sleep

did seem to have higher growth

27

00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:11,590

rates than their most

restful counterparts,

28

00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,770

but the gains

weren't considerable,

29

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,375

topping out at twelve percent higher

on a relative basis at the peak.

30

00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,855

Companies helmed by founders

receiving less than four hours

31

00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:22,255

of sleep per night were

essentially dead on with the

32

00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:25,150

founders who were getting the

fully recommended amount of sleep.

33

00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,990

And within the

interquartile range,

34

00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,870

we're actually trying

to grow at a lower rate.

35

00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,430

The story gets a bit more

interesting when looking at

36

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,925

founder happiness in

the context of sleep.

37

00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:38,045

We measured a founder NPS

or net promoter score,

38

00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:41,085

which was essentially looking

at how likely founders were to

39

00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:43,580

recommend becoming

a founder to others.

40

00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,460

We found that those individuals

getting the most sleep had the

41

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,580

highest founder NPS

with a score of seventy.

42

00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,980

They were very closely followed

by those founders averaging

43

00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,595

four to seven hours with

a score of sixty five,

44

00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:57,315

and those individuals receiving an

average amount of sleep over

45

00:01:57,315 --> 00:02:01,460

four hours per night had a fan

or MPS that plummeted to twelve.

46

00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,320

So what does this mean?

47

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,960

Well, this data e is highly

qualitative with plenty of

48

00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,065

lurking variables, so it

definitely has its limits.

49

00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:11,225

This seems to be an indication

that losing some sleep,

50

00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:14,565

which you're bound to do as a

founder, does have advantages.

51

00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:17,225

Of course, if you go too

far and get even less sleep,

52

00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:19,930

your well being is going

to hit rock bottom, man.

53

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,330

You're not going to gain the

growth trade offs that you

54

00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,815

think you will be by

sacrificing your health.

55

00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:25,855

All that being said,

56

00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,575

you have to keep in mind

that building a company is a

57

00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:31,135

marathon that appears

to be a sprint.

58

00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:32,500

You need to move quickly,

59

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,380

but you also need to be doing

things that are purposely built

60

00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,040

for the long term.

61

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,660

Well, that's it for now.

62

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,620
