# Are Remote Teams Growing Slower Than Their Co-located Counterparts?

On this episode of the ProfitWell Report, we answer a question about remote teams: how do they impact growth? To explore the power or lack thereof of remote, we looked at just over 3,000 subscription and SaaS companies. Here’s what we found.

_**Originally published: July 19th, 2019**_

This is the type of study that we’re going to lose friends over, even though there’s an incredible amount of nuance.

**[Remote company cultures](https://www.bamboohr.com/blog/telecommuting-company-culture-real-impact/)** have become more akin to a religion than a growth strategy with amazing people that I respect so, so very much, like **[DHH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson)** from **[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), [Nick Francis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickfrancis1/)** from **[Help Scout](https://www.helpscout.com/)** , and **[Wade Foster](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wadefoster/)** from**[Zapier](https://zapier.com/)** preaching the power of remote / **[working from home](https://blog.vantagecircle.com/work-from-home/). **

But first, if you like this kind of content and want to learn more, **[subscribe to get in the know](https://share.hsforms.com/17xcsifdtRi2xXbSPvncQow2fzi5)** when we release new episodes.

**In the early stages,** **remote companies are growing at a much slower rate than those companies where everyone is co-located.**

You’re seeing here a blend of a lot of different types of companies that are doing anywhere from $1M to $10M in annual revenue. Note that no matter the **[ARPU](https://www.paddle.com/resources/average-revenue-per-user)** , which is charitable proxy for different types of teams, **remote teams have growth rates that are roughly 20 to 30% lower than[co-located teams.](https://www.lifesize.com/en/resources/guides/video-conferencing-advantages-benefits)**

[![Remote Companies Grow Slower from $1M to $10M ARR](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cc467531ac2845a273b94_GRAPH1-2.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

What’s fascinating though is that **as companies get larger, this growth differential starts to diminish.**

When we look at a similar split of companies, but now looking at those doing $10M to $75M, you’ll note that the difference has essentially halved to remote teams growing 10 to 15% percent less than co-located teams.

[![Remote Companies Grow Slightly Slower from $10M to $75M ARR](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cc473531ac2845a273b95_GRAPH2-3.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

You’re obviously seeing some survivor bias with this data, but when you think about it, this trend stands to reason. By $10M you probably have figured out your main channels and definitely product/market fit, so remote is less of an issue.

That’s not to say that figuring out product market fit and your channels requires you to be in the same room with one another, but it’s likely easier.

**When we look at companies doing more than $75M, this growth differential essentially disappears, although the data is fairly sparse.**

[![Remote and Co-located Companies Grow Similarly Over $75M ARR](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cc490531ac2845a273b96_GRAPH3-1.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

That being said, most companies when you get to this level have evolved to a point where they’re remote anyways with multiple offices, a contingent of folks who **[work from home](https://www.adamenfroy.com/work-from-home-jobs)** , and obviously a high volume of different types of team members.

On the other hand, we do also see companies bring people back to the mothership when times get tough - like Yahoo and Reddit - to name a couple.

So should we say screw remote teams? Not exactly. There are a few big pieces to keep in mind here. For one, as stated previously **[all companies go remote](https://monday.com/blog/remote-work/remote-work-virtual-teams/) or multi-office at some point, so it’s not an argument of either/or, it’s more of an argument of when.**

Further, a lot more research needs to be done here, because the big question is why we’re seeing this data. Is it because co-located teams handle ambiguity better? Is it because of a technological connection problem that will diminish over time making the trend reverse?

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,335 --> 00:00:11,455

This is Shyamili, CEO

of Surfboard Digital.

4

00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:15,135

And my question to you

today is how do remote teams

5

00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:16,270

impact growth?

6

00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,070

Bye.

7

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,350

Welcome back, everyone. Neil

here for the ProfitWell Report.

8

00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,990

This is the type of study that

we are going to lose friends

9

00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,490

over even though there is

an incredible amount of nuance.

10

00:00:26,505 --> 00:00:29,545

Remote company cultures have

become more akin to a religion

11

00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:33,280

than a growth strategy with

amazing people that we respect

12

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,240

so so much, like Nick

Francis from Help Scout,

13

00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,760

Wade Foster from Zapier,

and DHH from Basecamp.

14

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,705

Yet what does the data

tell us about remote teams?

15

00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:45,425

To explore the power or

lack thereof of remote,

16

00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:47,745

we looked at just over

three thousand subscription

17

00:00:47,745 --> 00:00:49,890

companies, and

here's what we found.

18

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,090

In the early stages,

19

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,810

remote companies are growing at

a much slower rate than those

20

00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,970

companies where

everyone is co located.

21

00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,245

You're seeing here a blend of

a lot of different types of

22

00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:00,325

companies that are doing

anywhere from one to ten

23

00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:02,485

million in annual revenue.

24

00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:04,005

Note that no matter the ARPU,

25

00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:07,180

which is a charitable proxy

for different types of teams,

26

00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,500

remote teams have growth rates

that are roughly twenty to

27

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,840

thirty percent lower

than colocated teams.

28

00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,075

What's fascinating, though, is

that as companies get larger,

29

00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:18,635

this growth differential

starts to diminish.

30

00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:20,635

When we look at a similar

split of companies,

31

00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:23,595

but now looking at those doing

ten to seventy five million,

32

00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:25,810

you'll notice that the

difference has essentially half

33

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,770

the remote teams growing ten

to fifteen percent less than

34

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,530

colocated teams.

35

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,650

Now you're obviously seeing some

survivor bias with this data.

36

00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,055

But when you think about

it, this trend stands to reason.

37

00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,695

By ten million, you probably have

figured out your main channel is

38

00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:43,680

indefinitely product market fit,

so remote is less of an issue.

39

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,320

That's not to say that figuring

out product market fit and your

40

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,120

channel requires you to be in

the same room with one another,

41

00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,885

but it's likely easier.

42

00:01:50,885 --> 00:01:53,845

When we look at companies

doing more than seventy five million,

43

00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:56,485

this growth differential

essentially disappears,

44

00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:58,725

although the data

is fairly sparse.

45

00:01:58,725 --> 00:01:59,940

That being said,

46

00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,260

most companies when you get to

this level have evolved to a

47

00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,940

point where they're

remote anyways.

48

00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,340

Right?

49

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,060

With multiple offices,

contingent of folks who work

50

00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,695

from home, and obviously,

51

00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,775

a lot of different

types of team members.

52

00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:11,575

On the other hand,

53

00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:14,055

we do see companies bring

people back to the mothership

54

00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:17,750

when times get tough, like Yahoo

and Reddit to name a couple.

55

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,430

So should we say screw remote

teams? Not exactly. Right?

56

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,275

There are a few big pieces

to keep in mind here.

57

00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:25,875

For one, as stated previously,

58

00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:29,395

all companies go remote or multi

office at some point anyway.

59

00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:31,075

So it's not an

argument of either or.

60

00:02:31,075 --> 00:02:33,490

It's more of an

argument of when.

61

00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,130

Further, a lot more research needs

to be done here because the big

62

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,210

question is why we're

seeing this data.

63

00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,215

Is it because collocated

teams handle ambiguity better?

64

00:02:41,215 --> 00:02:42,975

Is it because of the

technological connection

65

00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:46,095

problem that will diminish over

time making this trend reverse?

66

00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:48,015

There are a lot of

unanswered questions here.

67

00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:52,160

Finally, though, this also assumes

growth is what you're optimizing for,

68

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,640

which I know sounds a little

preposterous to question,

69

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,400

but growth can have a cost on team

membership happiness and health.

70

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,025

You also may not care about

growth above everything else,

71

00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:03,745

which a lot of folks in the

remote camp have stated is not

72

00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:05,185

what they're all about.

73

00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,345

Ultimately, there's an

element of choice here,

74

00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:09,185

and more research is needed.

75

00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:11,090

For now, that's

all for this week.

76

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,050

If you have a question,

77

00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,170

send me an email or video to

nia at proper well dot com.

78

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,195

If you got value here or any

other week of the report,

because that's how we

know to keep doing this.

81

00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:24,415

I'll see you next week.
