# Is All Software Going to $0?

On today's episode of ProfitWell Report, we're answering a fascinating question about pricing in the software space: Is all software going to $0?

 _**This episode might reference ProfitWell and ProfitWell Recur, which following the acquisition by Paddle is now[Paddle Studios](https://www.paddle.com/studios). Some information may be out of date.**_

_**Originally published: April 17th, 2019**_

**To answer this question, we looked at over 2 million customers and their preferences around features and willingness to pay, and here’s what we found.**

Similar to the price of computers and memory, software prices have declined substantially since the 1980s and especially since the 90s and early 2000s when the cloud started to go mainstream. Costs have come down, buyer sophistication has increased, and information has become more symmetrical between buyers and sellers.

Where’s the floor though? After all, understanding the value cycles when it comes to features and functionality is crucial to ensuring you can defend your price.

**Well, software value is certainly declining.**

But first, if you like this kind of content and want to learn more, **[subscribe to get in the know](https://share.hsforms.com/17xcsifdtRi2xXbSPvncQow2fzi5)** when we release new episodes.

When looking at just over 900,000 customer data points, you’ll notice that **products and features have lost 70% of their value over the past five years** , meaning that Salesforce integration that you used to sell for $100 per month is now only worth $30 and in a lot of individual cases is probably worth just throwing into the core product.

The loss of value is shocking, but should feel pretty intuitive. After all, the cycles of production and shipping features has increased substantially.

You used to be able to give someone a database with a simple user interface and people thought you were a god. Now if the product doesn’t have good design and great support, it doesn’t matter what your core functionality is because it’s not going to pass as acceptable.

While the value will likely not go truly to zero, the pragmatic question becomes how quickly do products move from a place of value to a place of not being so valuable.

To answer this part, we need to introduce you to a model we’ve been talking about for a bit, but is probably something you haven’t seen before.

When you’re speaking about value of any product, anything from a cup of coffee to a piece of software, **there are two axes of value - the relative value of the features or attributes of that product and then the actual willingness to pay for that product.**

[![Measuring consumer sentiment for what we're building](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cc71d531ac2845a273bb0_Graph3-3.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

So if we look at a cup of coffee and we survey a large group using some clean statistical methodologies, we likely will find out that something like taste is the most important feature to that group and things like country of origin aren’t important in the aggregate.

[![Measuring consumer sentiment for what we're building](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cc72e531ac2845a273bb1_Graph4-2.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

When we layer on the willingness to pay data, we may find that those individuals that care about taste are willing to pay more, those who care about temperature less, and those who care about country of origin, there’s not a lot of them, but they are willing to pay more.

[![Measuring consumer sentiment for what we're building](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cc744531ac2845a273bb3_Graph5-2.webp?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Now if we have a feature where the value relative to other features is high and the willingness to pay of the group that cares about that feature is high, then we have a differentiable feature.

[![Calculating the expected impact of product on growth](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cc75c531ac2845a273bb5_Graph6.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

If we find a feature that is low value from a feature perspective, but has high willingness to pay, then we have an add-on.

[![Calculating the expected impact of product on growth](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cc771531ac2845a273bb6_Graph7.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Something that is high value, but low willingness to pay will be a core feature.

[![Calculating the expected impact of product on growth](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cc780531ac2845a273bb7_Graph8.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

And finally, something low value and low willingness to pay will be trash.

[![Calculating the expected impact of product on growth](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cc791531ac2845a273bb8_Graph9.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

I’m introducing this model, because we’ve been able to study millions of different customers in terms of preferences and further study how features flow from one quadrant to another.

Ten years ago the flow of features looked like this - moving from add-on to differentiable and a bit of core, as well as from differentiable to core.

[![Measuring consumer sentiment to what we're building](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cc7a2531ac2845a273bb9_Graph10.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

**The average time a feature took to move from one quadrant to another was at a pace of 8 to 10 years.** Today when measuring that velocity, this is what the movement looks like:

[![Measuring consumer sentiment to what we're building](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cc7b2531ac2845a273bba_Graph12.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Features are moving quicker and quicker toward not just core, but also not being valuable into the trash quadrant. **The average movement time from one quadrant to the next is now as low as 2 years.**

To be clear, this isn’t to say that the features you’re building aren’t valuable at all. However, given everything that’s happening in the market, the speed through which features are losing their premium value is extremely troubling given our approach to building product, **which is typically devoid of much data or[customer research](https://www.paddle.com/blog/quantify-buyer-personas) as we’ve seen in previous data studies.**

Ultimately, the speed of the market is out of our control with so many companies are out there creating value.

The secret now becomes owning your position in the market and working to find those pockets of value that move slowly between the quadrants, or at the very least getting to a point where you’re measuring the pulse of your customers to **understand exactly where you need to optimize your product for customer value, which trickles into retention and growth.**

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:09,055

Hey, Neil.

4

00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:11,935

This is Ryan Buckley,

the CEO of Mighty Signal.

5

00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:15,595

We've been thinking a lot about

pricing here, and I'm curious.

6

00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:18,720

Is the price of all

software going to zero?

7

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,000

Welcome back, everyone. Neil

here for the ProfitWell Report.

8

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,565

Similar to the price of

computers and memory,

9

00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:27,365

software prices have declined

substantially since the

10

00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:29,365

nineteen eighties and

especially since the nineties

11

00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:33,040

and the early two thousands when

the cloud started to go mainstream.

12

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,840

Costs have come down, buyer

sophistication has increased,

13

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,600

and information has become more

symmetrical between buyers and sellers.

14

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,145

Where's the floor though?

15

00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:44,745

After all, understanding the value

cycles when it comes to features and

16

00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:48,410

functionality is crucial to

ensuring you can defend your price.

17

00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,850

So to answer this question,

18

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,730

we looked at over two million

customers and their preferences

19

00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,810

around features and

willingness to pay.

20

00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,010

Here's what we found.

21

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,015

As to not bear the lead, software

value is certainly declining.

22

00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:03,455

When looking at just over nine

hundred thousand customer data points,

23

00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:05,935

you'll notice that products

and features have lost seventy

24

00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:08,800

percent of their value

over the past five years.

25

00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,280

Meaning that the Salesforce

integration that you used to

26

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,385

sell for a hundred dollars per month

is now only worth thirty dollars.

27

00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:17,345

And and a lot of individual

cases probably worth just

28

00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:19,025

throwing into the core product.

29

00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:20,785

The loss of value is shocking,

30

00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:22,705

but should feel

pretty intuitive.

31

00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:24,730

After all, the

cycles of production

32

00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,445

database with a simple UI, and

people thought you were a god.

33

00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:35,485

Now if the product doesn't have

good design and great support,

34

00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:38,365

it doesn't really matter what

your core functionality is.

35

00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,780

It's not gonna pass as valuable.

36

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,687

To answer this part,

37

00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:42,504

we need to introduce you to a

model we've been talking about

38

00:01:42,504 --> 00:01:44,120

for a while.

39

00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:51,175

To answer this part,

40

00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:54,135

we need to introduce you to a model

we've been talking about for a while,

41

00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:56,855

but it's probably something

you haven't seen before.

42

00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:59,240

When you're speaking about

the value of a product,

43

00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,120

anything from a cup of coffee

to a piece of software,

44

00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,120

there are two axes of value,

45

00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,885

the relative value of the

features or attribute of that

46

00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:10,245

product and then the actual

willingness to pay for that product.

47

00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:12,645

So if we look at a cup of

coffee and we survey a large

48

00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:15,265

group using some clean

statistical methodologies,

49

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,340

we'll likely find out that

something like taste is the

50

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,420

most important

feature to that group,

51

00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,505

while things like country of origin

aren't that important in the aggregate.

52

00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:26,925

When we layer on

willingness to pay data,

53

00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:29,245

we may find that those

individuals that care about

54

00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:31,490

taste are willing to pay more,

55

00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,970

Those who care about

temperature less and those who

56

00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,210

care about country

of origin, well,

57

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,170

there's not a lot of them, but

they are willing to pay more.

58

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,205

Now, if we have a feature where

the value relative to other

59

00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,845

features is high and the

willingness to pay for that

60

00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:47,325

group that cares about

that feature is high,

61

00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:49,840

then we have a

differentiable feature.

62

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,240

If you find a feature that

is low value from a feature

63

00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,800

perspective but has

high willingness to pay,

64

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,560

then we have an add on.

65

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,125

Something that is high value

but low willingness to pay will

66

00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,245

be a core feature,

67

00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:04,325

and then something low value and low

willingness to pay will be trash.

68

00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:06,965

We're introducing this model

because we've been able to

69

00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:09,430

study millions of different

customers in terms of

70

00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,630

preferences and further study

how features flow from one

71

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,150

quadrant to another.

72

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,790

Ten years ago, the flow

of features looked like this,

73

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,985

moving from add on to

differentiable and a bit of

74

00:03:19,985 --> 00:03:22,785

core, as well as from

differentiable to core.

75

00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,425

The average time a feature took

to move from one quadrant to

76

00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:28,590

another was at a pace

of eight to ten years.

77

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,070

Today, when measuring

that velocity,

78

00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,390

this is what the

movement looks like.

79

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,595

Features are moving quicker and

quicker towards not just core,

80

00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:39,955

but also not being valuable

into the trash quadrant.

81

00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:42,835

The average movement time from

one quadrant to the next is now

82

00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:44,770

as low as two years.

83

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,150

To be clear, this isn't to say that

the features you're building aren't

84

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,190

valuable at all.

85

00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,745

But given everything that's

happening in the market,

86

00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:53,585

the speed through which

features are losing their

87

00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:56,625

premium value is extremely

troubling given our approach to

88

00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,585

building product,

89

00:03:57,585 --> 00:04:00,440

which is typically devoid of

much data or customer research

90

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,680

as we've seen in

previous data studies.

91

00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,360

Ultimately, the speed of the market

is out of our control given just how

92

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,845

many companies are out

there creating value.

93

00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:12,205

The secret now becomes owning

your position in the market and

94

00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:14,765

working to find those pockets

of value that move slowly

95

00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:18,130

between the quadrants or at the

very least getting to a point

96

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,610

where you're measuring the

pulse of your customers to

97

00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,170

understand exactly where you

need to optimize your product

98

00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,295

for customer value,

which, you know,

99

00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:27,455

trickles into

retention and growth.

100

00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:29,215

Well, that's all for now.

101

00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:30,175
