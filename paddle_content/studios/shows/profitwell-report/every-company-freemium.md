# Is every company destined for freemium?

On this episode of the ProfitWell Report we break down wether or not every company will go freemium in the future. To answer the question, we studied a few thousand SaaS and subscription companies, as well as the willingness to pay data from over fifty thousand buyers.

_**Originally published: April 10, 2019**_

**"Freemium is an acquisition model, not a revenue model."**

That’s something I’ve been preaching for a long time now, because too many people think **[freemium](https://www.paddle.com/resources/freemium)** is part of their **[pricing strategy](https://www.paddle.com/resources/pricing-strategy)**. Even so, the debate whether you should have a free product or you shouldn’t ever go after a free product has been raging for multiple cycles over the past couple of decades.

Yet, let’s settle the debate or at least support one side over the other here by looking at the data we collected.

But first, if you like this kind of content and want to learn more, **[subscribe to get in the know](https://share.hsforms.com/17xcsifdtRi2xXbSPvncQow2fzi5)** when we release new episodes.

What we found: **Freemium will be a pillar of everyone’s growth strategies in the future.** This doesn’t mean you’ll have a free plan related to your current product, but you’ll still have some element of free. Here’s why.

  
When you look at the market, and it doesn’t really matter if you’re in B2B or in B2C, **[customer acquisition cost](https://www.paddle.com/resources/customer-acquisition-cost) is rising substantially**. A customer that cost you $100 five years ago is actually costing you $150 to $170 today, because of the density that exists in the market. 

[![CAC for Free isn't Growing at the Same Rate as Paid](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659ca9d6531ac2845a273b5b_Graph1-6.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

We’re all running ads. Everyone and their mother has an ebook. **It’s just a dense market.**

Interestingly though, **CAC for customers acquired through freemium is actually almost half** , and even free trials are garnering 15% less CAC on an absolute basis.

The implications of free go deeper though, because it’s not just a cost problem we’re facing in the market. **The relative value of features is actually declining substantially.**

As you can see here over the past five years, different features, including products’s core functionality have lost essentially 70% in terms of value and willingness to pay.

[![Consumer Willingness to Pay has Declined Over Time](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659ca9e4531ac2845a273b5c_Graph2-4.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

This is because there’s just a lot of product out there. The barriers to building a business, for most businesses, especially in the subscription and SaaS space is no longer building the actual technology.

All of this ease of building technology gives us the most overused slide in any marketing presentation with all of these companies on the Martech landscape, but keep in mind these are only the marketing companies.

![Marketing Landscape](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659ca9f5531ac2845a273b5d_Graph3-2.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

How is this connected to free though?

Well, if it’s harder and harder to acquire a customer through content and all the channels we’re currently using, and it’s easier to build product, and the relative value of product is declining, **we need a way to hook people in and lower that activation energy to becoming a customer.**

Free is one of the avenues to doing just that, and you see it in many of the core unit economics that stem from free. CAC as we already discussed is lower, **but retention of customers who were acquired through free is also noticeably better.**

Those individuals who converted from a freemium plan have nearly 20% better net retention on an absolute basis than their non-free counterparts.

[![Retention is noticeably better for freemium products](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659caa03531ac2845a273b5e_Graph4-1.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Essentially, these customers were allowed to nurture on free as long as they needed before being eased into converting to a free customer. As markets become denser and denser retention is going to be a bigger and bigger need when it comes to evaluating the customers and tactics we use long term.

Further, **freemium customers tend to have much better customer satisfaction** as measured through Net promoter score or NPS.

Those customers acquired through freemium means typically have double the NPS as their non-free counterparts, which is up from just over 30% higher NPS five years ago.

[![NPS is greater for companies with freemium products](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659caa10531ac2845a273b5f_Graph5-1.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

A critical piece of knowledge we’re missing involves the growth implications of freemium under most current acquisition models. Most of us just aren’t ready for a freemium push, because we’re not good enough at even converting traditional leads through high experience sales interactions and the like.

More research certainly needs to be done here to put the proverbial nail in the coffin of freemium being the future, but if I was a betting man, **I wouldn’t bet against freemium, especially given all of the NPS and retention implications.**

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:09,285

Hey, Neil.

4

00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:11,205

This is David, CEO of Webforum,

5

00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:14,805

the leading Scandinavian platform

for large construction projects.

6

00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,130

What I'd like to know is,

7

00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,250

will every company have

freemium at some point?

8

00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,430

What's up, everyone? Neil here

for the ProfitWell Report.

9

00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,675

Freemium is an acquisition

model, not a revenue model.

10

00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:28,995

That's something that we've

been preaching for a long time

11

00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,115

now because too many people

think freemium is part of their

12

00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,695

pricing strategy.

13

00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,000

Even so, the debate whether or not

you should have a free product or

14

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,960

you shouldn't ever go after a

free product has been raging

15

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,165

for multiple cycles over

the past couple of decades.

16

00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:46,685

Yet let's settle the debate or

at least support one side over

17

00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:50,285

the other by answering this

question after studying a few

18

00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:52,560

thousand SaaS and

subscription companies

19

00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:01,561

This doesn't mean you'll have

to have a free plan related to

20

00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,365

your current product, but

you'll still have some element

21

00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:04,265

of free, and here's why.

22

00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:04,905

When you look at the market,

23

00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:07,845

and it really doesn't

matter if you're in b to

24

00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,430

you're in b to b or b to c,

25

00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,310

customer acquisition cost

is rising substantially.

26

00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,190

A customer that cost you a

hundred dollars five years ago

27

00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,235

is actually costing you a

hundred and fifty to one

28

00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:23,035

seventy today because of

the density in the market.

29

00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:26,850

We're all running ads. Everyone

and their mother has an ebook.

30

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,910

It's just a dense market.

31

00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,450

Interestingly enough, though,

32

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,810

CAC for customers acquired through

freemium is actually almost half,

33

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,865

and even free trials trials are

garnering fifty percent less

34

00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:38,945

CAC on an absolute basis.

35

00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:41,105

The implications of

free go deeper, though,

36

00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:44,390

because it's not just a cost

problem we're facing in the market.

37

00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,290

The relative value of features is

actually declining substantially.

38

00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,270

As you can see here,

over the past five years,

39

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,025

different features including

products core functionality,

40

00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:56,745

has lost essentially seventy

percent in terms of value and

41

00:01:56,745 --> 00:01:58,105

willingness to pay.

42

00:01:58,105 --> 00:02:00,730

This is because there's just

a lot of product out there.

43

00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,610

The barriers to building a

business for most businesses,

44

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,770

especially in the

subscription and SaaS space,

45

00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,470

is no longer building

the actual technology.

46

00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:11,035

All this ease of building

technology gives us the most

47

00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:14,075

overused slide in any marketing

presentation with all these

48

00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:16,090

companies in the

martech landscape.

49

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,290

But keep in mind, these are

only the marketing companies.

50

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,370

How is this connected

to free, though?

51

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,245

Well, if it's harder and harder

to acquire customer through

52

00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:27,365

content and all the channels

we're currently using and it's

53

00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:31,820

easier to build product and the

relative value of product is declining,

54

00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,540

we need a way to hook people

in and lower their activation

55

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,460

energy to becoming a customer.

56

00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,620

Free is one of the avenues

to doing just that,

57

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,675

and you see in many of the core unit

economics economics that stem from free.

58

00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:42,660

CAC, as we already

discussed, is lower,

59

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:42,783

but retention of customers who

are acquired through free is

60

00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:44,135

also noticeably better.

61

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,400

Those individuals who converted

from a freemium plan have

62

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,200

nearly twenty percent better

net retention on an absolute

63

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,615

basis than their non

free Essentially,

64

00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:01,735

these customers were allowed to

nurture on free as long as it

65

00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:05,170

needed before being eased into

converting to a free customer.

66

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,190

As markets become

denser and denser,

67

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,150

retention is gonna be a bigger

and bigger need when it comes

68

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,915

to evaluating the customers

and tactics we use long term.

69

00:03:13,915 --> 00:03:17,275

Further, freemium customers tend

to have much better customer

70

00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:19,755

satisfaction as measured

through net promoter score or

71

00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:20,855

NPS.

72

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,370

Those customers acquired

through freemium means

73

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,650

typically have double the MPS

as their non free counterparts,

74

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,265

which is up from just over thirty

percent higher MPS five years ago.

75

00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:32,585

A critical piece of the

knowledge we're missing here

76

00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:35,065

involves the growth

implications of freemium under

77

00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:37,280

most current acquisition models.

78

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,400

Most of us just aren't ready

for a freemium push because

79

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,440

we're not that good even at

converting traditional leads

80

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,565

through high experience sales

interactions and the like.

81

00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:49,145

More research needs to be done

here to really put the nail in

82

00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,865

the coffin on freemium

being the future.

83

00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:55,420

But if I was a betting man, I

would not bet against freemium,

84

00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,620

especially given all the NPS

and retention implications.

85

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,060

Well, that's all for now.

86

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,180
