#### Main Takeaways:

  * Companies using freemium have 50% lower [CAC](https://www.profitwell.com/blog/the-complete-saas-guide-to-calculating-and-reducing-cac). 
  * Net revenue retention is 15% higher for freemium companies. 
  * NPS is nearly double for freemium companies. 
  * Willingness to pay for tiers above freemium have increased over 500%. 


To answer Hiten's question, we'll dig into the data from nearly 6,000 companies across both B2B and B2C, as well as roughly 300,000 willingness to pay data points. Let's jump in.

#### Freemium is an acquisition model

Freemium is an [acquisition](https://www.paddle.com/resources/customer-acquisition-cost) model, not a revenue model, so this is a measured strategy to unlock lower CAC and the top of your funnel.  
  
[CAC](https://www.paddle.com/resources/cac-ltv-ratio) is increasing across the board with B2B and B2C CAC up nearly 50% compared to a few years ago as marketing density continues to increase.

[![Customer acquisition cost has increased significantly](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659c7961531ac2845a273a74_cacincreasinghitenshah.webp?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

That being said, CAC for freemium companies is only 25-30% higher than 5 years ago:

[![CAC for free isn't growing at the same rate as paid](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659c7963531ac2845a273a76_freecacpaidcachitenshah.webp?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

#### Content effectiveness is trending down

Diminishing returns of traditional free offers like free ebooks or white papers give us a look into this phenomenon. Note that the life of an ebook has dropped from being effective for roughly 6 months to now only being effective for less than a quarter. This is happening even though the quality of content as we saw in a previous study continues to increase. 

[![The Life of an Ebook has greatly diminished due to density](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659c7962531ac2845a273a75_ebooklifehitenshah.webp?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Essentially, free products are becoming "premium ebooks" where the goal is to lower the activation energy required to start a relationship with a lead and push them to a purchase, as well as give you an opportunity to nurture that lead into perpetuity.

#### Free is positively affecting key business metrics

Free has actually become more effective than non-free alternatives. [Retention](https://www.paddle.com/resources/calculate-retention-rate) is 15% better on an absolute basis for those companies utilizing the freemium strategy:

[![Retention is noticeable better for freemium products](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659c7965531ac2845a273a78_retentionfreemiumhitenshah-compressor.webp?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

[NPS](https://www.paddle.com/resources/saas-retention-strategies) is roughly 50% better for those companies utilizing freemium:

[![NPS is greater for companies with freemium products](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659c7964531ac2845a273a77_npsfreemiumhitenshah.webp?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

And the previous objection of a free plan eroding value is actually softening with the willingness to pay for an initial tier growing from a floor of roughly $150 five years ago to close to $1,000 today.

[![WTP for initial tier from free has increased](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659c7966531ac2845a273a79_willingnesstopayfreemiumhitenshah.webp?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

#### Freemium is a scalpel, not a sledgehammer

So should you jump on the free bandwagon? Probably. Although, while the data suggests some serious benefits, you should keep in mind that freemium is a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. We've seen the most effective freemium plans come when a company has been around for a few years and figured out their unit economics before opening the top of the funnel with free. 

That's all for this week. We look forward to bringing you more data and insights about the subscription economy next week.

1

00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,660

You've got the questions

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,360

Each week, we dive deep on benchmarks

of the subscription economy that

3

00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,095

you just can't

get anywhere else.

4

00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:14,015

This is the ProfitWell Report.

5

00:00:16,195 --> 00:00:16,835

Hey, Patrick.

6

00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:19,890

It's Heaton and Ralph, and

we've got a question for you.

7

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,530

If I'm starting a SaaS business

today and I'm considering

8

00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,090

freemium, what's the

latest and greatest data?

9

00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,445

What's the latest and greatest

information that I need to know

10

00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,585

right now before I start?

11

00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:34,670

Oh, freemium. I have been on

both sides of this debate.

12

00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,190

So to answer Heaton's question,

13

00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,070

we'll dig into the data from

nearly six thousand different

14

00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,105

subscription companies

across b to b and b to c,

15

00:00:42,105 --> 00:00:44,185

as well as roughly three

hundred thousand different

16

00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:45,785

willingness to pay data points.

17

00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:46,985

So let's jump in.

18

00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:50,030

It's important to note that

freemium is an acquisition

19

00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,790

model, not a revenue model.

20

00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,470

So this is a measured strategy

to unlock lower CAC and

21

00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,390

increase your top of the funnel.

22

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,045

CAC is increasing across the board with

b to b and b to c

23

00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:04,725

CAC up nearly fifty percent

compared to five years ago as

24

00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:07,525

marketing density

continues to increase.

25

00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,910

That being said, CAC amongst freemium

companies is actually only up twenty five

26

00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,470

to thirty percent

versus five years ago.

27

00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,270

The diminishing returns of

traditional free offers like

28

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,495

free ebooks or white papers give

us a look into this phenomenon.

29

00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:24,055

Note that the life of an

ebook has dropped from being

30

00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:26,775

effective for roughly six

months to now only being

31

00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:28,920

effective for less

than a quarter.

32

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,640

This is happening even though

the quality of content as we

33

00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,840

saw in a previous study

continues to increase.

34

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,915

Essentially, free

products are becoming give

35

00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:39,915

you

36

00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:41,915

an

37

00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:43,915

opportunity

38

00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:48,480

to nurture give you an

opportunity to nurture that

39

00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,920

lead into perpetuity.

40

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,380

Free has actually become more

effective than non free alternatives.

41

00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,115

Retention is fifteen percent

better on an absolute basis for

42

00:01:58,115 --> 00:02:00,675

those companies utilizing

the freemium model.

43

00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:03,635

NPS is roughly fifty percent

better for those companies

44

00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:04,675

utilizing freemium,

45

00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:08,650

and the previous objection of

a free plan eroding value is

46

00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,010

actually softening with the

willingness to pay for an initial tier,

47

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,595

growing from a floor of roughly

a hundred and fifty dollars

48

00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:17,795

five years ago to close to

a thousand dollars today.

49

00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:20,815

So should you jump on

the free bandwagon?

50

00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:22,870

Probably. Yeah.

51

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,310

Although, while the data does

suggest some serious benefits,

52

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,190

you should keep in mind

that freemium is a scalpel,

53

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,690

not a sledgehammer.

54

00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,505

We've seen the most effective

freemium plans come when a

55

00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:36,465

company has been around for a

few years and figured out their

56

00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:40,330

unit economics before opening up

the top of the funnel with free.

57

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,290

We wrote more on this in our

hundred plus page research

58

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,730

study on freemium entitled

the freemium manifesto,

59

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,435

which you can find below.

60

00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,955

But that's all for now.
