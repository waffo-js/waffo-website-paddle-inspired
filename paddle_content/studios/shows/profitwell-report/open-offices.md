# Your Open Office Space May be Tainting Your Subscription Growth

On this episode of the ProfitWell Report, we break down data on how open offices impact subscription growth.

 _**This episode might reference ProfitWell and ProfitWell Recur, which following the acquisition by Paddle is now[Paddle Studios](https://www.paddle.com/studios). Some information may be out of date.**_

_**Originally published: January 29, 2018**_

While open offices were around as early as the 1750s, they didn’t really gain popularity until the early 1900s when famous American architect **[Frank Lloyd Wright](https://franklloydwright.org/)** started to popularize them through his designs.

Then, in the 1950s, the Burolandschaft movement out of Germany was pushed forward by **[Herman Miller’s](https://www.hermanmiller.com/) [action offices](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/workspaces/workstations/action-office-system/)**, considered the best way to **[design an office](https://www.bamboohr.com/blog/creating-comfortable-workplace-setup/)** at the time.

Now the thing to keep in mind here is that these open offices were not the open offices a lot of us have today. They were cathedrals with tons of nooks and crannies to balance the collaboration dream of open offices with the need for distraction free zones. Like most good ideas, we all then bastardized it with the IKEA rows of desks a lot of us work in today.

I’m sure that was more office architecture knowledge than you wanted, so let’s get to the data. **We studied just over one thousand subscription and SaaS companies who had teams that were co-located in the same location.**

But first, if you like this kind of content and want to learn more, **[subscribe to get in the know](https://share.hsforms.com/17xcsifdtRi2xXbSPvncQow2fzi5)** when we release new episodes.

Open offices didn’t impact overall growth as much as I thought it would.

What you’re seeing here is the relative **[growth rate](https://www.paddle.com/resources/growth-rate) **of open office environments compared to those who have closed offices or some arrangement for everyone to have their own space.

[![Open Offices Correlate with Lower Growth](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cb529531ac2845a273b78_GRAPH1-3.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Notice how **open offices at each of these ARPU levels only have show 6 to 12% lower growth on a relative basis compared to their closed office counterparts.** Don’t get me wrong, I’ll always take an extra 10% when it comes to growth, but when you think of cost savings, maybe that 10% isn’t too bad of a loss.

Here’s a fascinating finding though: **Companies with open offices tend to have much worse gross churn than their closed office counterparts.**

As you’ll see here, the data indicates that **open offices have 11 to 18% higher[gross churn rates](https://www.paddle.com/resources/calculate-churn-rate)** than their closed office counterparts.

[![Open Offices Correlate with Higher Churn Rates](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cb536531ac2845a273b79_GRAPH2-4.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

What in the world is happening here? Well, my instinct tells me that this comes down to developer and product productivity. If you think about where a lot of growth comes from, you have elements of growth that are marketing and sales and elements of growth that are product.

Yet, it’s relatively easy to turn up sales and marketing. Not easy, but comparatively easy. Turning these up can overcome churn problems and think about the bullpens of sales teams - they feed off of one another and the distraction is almost ok.

Churn always creeps up at some point, and gross churn is almost purely a product problem, **so** **if your development and product teams are distracted, aren’t productive, or aren’t happy because of those things, you’re likely not going to have the ability to solve your churn.**

That being said, there are likely a lot of lurking variables here, so we probably shouldn’t take this as the nail in the coffin for **[open offices](https://www.andcards.com/blog/productivity/super-flex-office/)**. More research needs to be done, but in the context of all the other research that’s been completed, **focusing a bit more on distraction free product productivity is likely worthy of your focus.**

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,785 --> 00:00:10,065

Hey, Neil. This is Sarah.

4

00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:13,185

I'm one of the cofounders and

the head of marketing at Compt.

5

00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:13,905

I'm curious.

6

00:00:13,905 --> 00:00:16,760

Do you have any data on how

open office offices impact

7

00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,960

subscription growth?

8

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,920

Thanks.

9

00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,800

Welcome back, everyone. Neil

here for the ProfitWell Report.

10

00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,200

This is a fascinating question.

11

00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,975

Because while open offices

were around as early as the

12

00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:28,095

seventeen fifties,

13

00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,495

they didn't really gain

popularity until the early

14

00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:33,135

nineteen hundreds when Frank

Lloyd Wright started to

15

00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:35,040

popularize them

through his designs.

16

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,600

And then the Burelenschaft

movement out of Germany was

17

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,480

pushed forward by Herman

Miller's action offices in the

18

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,245

nineteen fifties as the best

way to design an office.

19

00:00:43,245 --> 00:00:46,605

Now, the thing to keep in mind here

is that these open offices were

20

00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:48,925

not the open offices a

lot of us have today.

21

00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:52,080

They were cathedrals with

tons of nooks and crannies to

22

00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,680

balance the collaboration dream

of open offices with the need

23

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,855

for distraction free zones.

24

00:00:57,855 --> 00:00:59,055

Like most good ideas,

25

00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:02,335

we all then bastardized it with

the IKEA rows of desks and a

26

00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:03,935

lot of us work in today.

27

00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:06,415

I'm sure that was more office

architecture knowledge than you

28

00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:08,490

wanted, so let's

get to the data.

29

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,610

We studied just over one

thousand subscription and SaaS

30

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,290

companies who had teams that were

co located in the same location.

31

00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,235

Open offices didn't impact

overall growth as much as I

32

00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:19,515

thought it would.

33

00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:21,915

What you're seeing here is the

relative growth rate of open

34

00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,120

office environments compared to

those who have closed offices

35

00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:36,215

lower growth on a relative

basis compared to their closed

36

00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:37,715

office counterparts.

37

00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:38,855

Don't get me wrong.

38

00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:40,935

I'll always take an extra

ten percent when it comes to

39

00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,330

growth, but when you

think of the cost savings,

40

00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,130

maybe ten percent isn't

that bad of a loss.

41

00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,810

Before I get ahead

of myself, though,

42

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,730

here's a fascinating finding.

43

00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,530

Companies with open offices

tend to have much worse gross

44

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,225

churn than their closed

office counterparts.

45

00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:56,365

As you'll see here,

46

00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:59,565

the data indicates that open

offices have eleven to eighteen

47

00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:03,080

percent higher gross churn rates than

their closed office counterparts.

48

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,680

What in the world

is happening here?

49

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,960

Well, my instinct tells me that

this comes down to developer and

50

00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,315

product productivity.

51

00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:12,555

If you think about where a

lot of growth comes from,

52

00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:15,275

you have elements of growth

that are marketing and sales

53

00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,480

and elements of growth

that are product.

54

00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,760

Yet, it's relatively easy to

turn up sales and marketing.

55

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,480

Not easy, but

comparatively easy.

56

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,035

Turning these up can

overcome churn problems.

57

00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:28,355

And think about

bullpens of sales teams.

58

00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:29,555

They feed off of one another,

59

00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:32,095

and the distraction

is almost okay.

60

00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:34,580

Yet churn always creeps

up at some point,

61

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,940

and gross churn is almost

a purely a product problem.

62

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,580

So if your dev and product

teams are distracted,

63

00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,635

aren't productive, or aren't

happy because of those things,

64

00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:46,515

you're likely not gonna have

the ability to solve your churn.

65

00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:49,475

That being said, there are likely

a lot of lurking variables here,

66

00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:52,880

so we probably shouldn't take

this as the nail in the coffin

67

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,700

the

68

00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:04,485

is likely worthy of your focus.

69

00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,005

Well, that's it for now.

70

00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:06,965

71

00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:09,925
