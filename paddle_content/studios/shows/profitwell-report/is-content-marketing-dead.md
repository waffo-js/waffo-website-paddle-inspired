Here's data from over 10k blogs and over 1k companies that we studied to provide benchmarks for content marketing customer acquisition cost (CAC).

 _**This episode might reference ProfitWell and ProfitWell Recur, which following the acquisition by Paddle is now[Paddle Studios](https://www.paddle.com/studios). Some information may be out of date.**_

_**Originally published: February 5th, 2018**_

Acquiring customers is becoming more difficult and expensive. We're being exposed to more content than ever before, and the impact is content marketing is becoming one of the most saturated marketing channels in our arsenal.

Should you stop blogging though? That's the question we set out to answer in epsiode two of the ProfitWell Report, sparked by a question from [Brian Balfour](https://brianbalfour.com/), CEO of [Reforge](https://www.reforge.com/).

[Content marketing](https://compose.ly/strategy/content-marketing-roi/) has never been more in vogue. Off the back of [Wordpress](https://wizve.com/what-is-wordpress/), HubSpot, Marketo, [WooRank](https://www.woorank.com/), and countless other companies, the U.S. is about to see nearly 30MM blogs, and the entire world is seeing roughly 5 times that.

To answer Brian's question we looked at over ten thousand different blogs, two orders of magnitude [more blog posts](https://www.ryrob.com/how-write-blog-post/), as well as nearly one thousand different subscription companies. Here's what we found.

But first, if you like this kind of content and want to learn more, [**subscribe to get in the know**](https://share.hsforms.com/17xcsifdtRi2xXbSPvncQow2fzi5) when we release new episodes.

#### Overall CAC is up nearly 50% over the past five years

[Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)](/shows/presents/cac-payback) is up across the board for both B2B and B2C companies has increased by nearly 50% over the past five years. Yet, CAC based on channel tells a different story. While paid CAC is still higher than that of [content marketing](https://appinstitute.com/content-marketing-tips/), CAC for content is actually closing the gap very quickly.

Essentially, we're finally seeing content marketing come into it's own and mature like the paid world did a few years back.

#### Content quality and output increasing dramatically

Compared to five years ago, [we're publishing over 300% more per month](https://pages.beckon.com/rs/976-IET-418/images/Marketing-Truth-or-Marketing-Hype-Beckon-Report.pdf), we're writing posts that are [nearly 100% longer in word count](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics), and we're paying content marketers and creators nearly 25% more, with a shoutout to HubSpot for making content marketers in our backyard of Boston 40% more expensive.

[![contentsalary.jpeg](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/Zjg4YWRkNDgtNjZhYi00ZjYyLTgxZjYtODdkYjIyODY4Mjky_contentsalary.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

#### Content effectiveness dropping compared to the past

Quality is increasing, but content effectiveness is dropping. The average number of [shares per post has actually fallen by nearly 90%](https://www.impactbnd.com/) compared to two years ago.

Plus, the life of an offer - like an ebook - is actually dropping in effectiveness, as measured through lead velocity. An offer's effectiveness used to be roughly 6 months, whereas today that effectiveness has dropped to less than three.

[![ebookeffectiveness.jpeg](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/OGFhYTY2NGYtMjljMS00NTg2LTlkOTctYmMyNjRjNGY4NDlm_ebookeffectiveness.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

#### Is content marketing dead?

So, is content marketing dead? Are we going to delete our HubSpot account as soon as we get done with this post? Of course not. Now is the time you need companies like [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) more than ever. Think of it this way - if the cost for me to give you a dollar goes from ten cents to twenty five cents, you'd be insane not to still pay me for the dollar. Content is getting mature, but the [ROI is still amazing](https://bluetree.ai/saas-statistics/).

[47% of buyers still view 3-5 pieces of content](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics) before engaging with a sales rep, companies with blogs still get 67% more leads than those that don't, and inbound close rates are still 8-10x those of outbound efforts.

Plus, CAC Ratio's for content still tends to be roughly 30% better than the paid side, because of the compounding nature of content.

1

00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,660

You've got the questions

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,360

Each week, we dive deep on benchmarks

of the subscription economy that

3

00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,095

you just can't

get anywhere else.

4

00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:13,935

This is the ProfitWell Report.

5

00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:18,160

Patrick, what's up, my man?

It's It's Brian Belfort.

6

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,840

I wanna know, since over the past

five years an explosion in content

7

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,080

marketing, is that channel

becoming more effective,

8

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,545

less effective, or

staying the same?

9

00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:29,505

Another phenomenal question

because content marketing has

10

00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:30,945

never been more in vogue.

11

00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:33,265

Off the back of WordPress,

HubSpot, Marketo,

12

00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:34,900

and countless other companies,

13

00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,780

the US is about to see nearly

thirty million blogs and the

14

00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,340

entire world is seeing

five times that.

15

00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,620

So to answer Brian's question,

16

00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,075

we looked at over ten

thousand different blogs,

17

00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:46,555

two orders of magnitude

more blog posts,

18

00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:48,875

as well as nearly one thousand

different subscription

19

00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,875

companies, and

here's what we found.

20

00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:54,170

CAC across the board for b

to b and b to c companies has

21

00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,610

increased by nearly fifty

percent over the past five years.

22

00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,210

Yet interestingly enough,

23

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,735

CAC based on channel

tells a different story.

24

00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:04,935

While paid CAC is still higher

than that of content marketing,

25

00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:08,455

CAC for content is actually

closing the gap very quickly.

26

00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:12,210

Essentially, we're finally seeing

content marketing come into its own and

27

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,250

mature like the paid

world did a few years ago.

28

00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,370

Compared to five years ago,

29

00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,585

we're actually publishing over three

hundred percent more per month.

30

00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:22,865

We're writing posts that are nearly a

hundred percent longer in word count,

31

00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:25,425

and we're paying content

marketers and creators nearly

32

00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:28,480

twenty five percent more with

a special shout out to HubSpot

33

00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,920

for making content marketers in

our backyard of Boston actually

34

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,980

forty percent more expensive.

35

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,655

That being said though, quality

is increasing, but content

36

00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:40,735

effectiveness is dropping.

37

00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:43,960

The average number of shares

per post has actually fallen by

38

00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,080

nearly ninety percent

compared to two years ago.

39

00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,605

Plus, the life of an offer like

an ebook is actually dropping in

40

00:01:50,605 --> 00:01:53,325

effectiveness as measured

through lead velocity.

41

00:01:53,325 --> 00:01:56,525

An offer's effectiveness used

to be roughly six months,

42

00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:59,085

whereas today that

effectiveness has dropped to

43

00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,230

less than three.

44

00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,150

So is content marketing dead?

45

00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,990

Are we gonna delete our HubSpot account

as soon as we're done with this video?

46

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,030

Of course not.

47

00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,015

Now is the time you need companies

like HubSpot more than ever.

48

00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:12,215

Think of it this way.

49

00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,735

If the cost for me to give you

a dollar goes from ten cents to

50

00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,015

twenty five cents,

51

00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:20,980

you'd still be insane not to

pay for that particular dollar.

52

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,385

Content is getting mature,

but it's still ROI amazing.

53

00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:28,345

Forty seven percent of buyers

still view three to five pieces

54

00:02:28,345 --> 00:02:30,905

of content before engaging

with a sales team.

55

00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:34,440

Companies with blogs still get

sixty seven percent more leads

56

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,720

than those who don't,

57

00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,080

and inbound close rates are

still eight to ten x those of

58

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,680

their outbound counterparts.

59

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,635

Plus, CAC ratios for content

still tend to be roughly thirty

60

00:02:44,635 --> 00:02:47,195

percent better than the

paid side of the house,

61

00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:51,064

simply because of the

compounding profit well

62

00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:53,307

dot

63

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:54,700

64

00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,050
