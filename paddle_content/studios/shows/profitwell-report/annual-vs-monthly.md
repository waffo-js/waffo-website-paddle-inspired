# Annual Plans Reduce Churn Dramatically, Data Finds

On this episode of the ProfitWell Report, we're breaking down what proportion of paid plans should be annual versus monthly. To answer Brendan's question, we gathered data from just over two and a half thousand subscription companies.

The beauty of the subscription model is that for the first time in the history of business, relationships are baked directly into how you make money. Every month, year, or however long the term of the subscription is, your customer has a decision to make around if they’re receiving the value for which they’re paying.

If they don’t feel like they’re getting value, then they’ll[**churn**](https://www.paddle.com/resources/customer-churn). If they do feel they’re getting value, they’ll renew.

But first, if you like this kind of content and want to learn more, [**subscribe to get in the know**](https://share.hsforms.com/17xcsifdtRi2xXbSPvncQow2fzi5) when we release new episodes.

#### 

Having a longer term length or an annual subscription can make this easier on you, because the customer is making a deeper commitment that allows you to plead your value case with enough time to show value. **Hence why annuals can be instrumental in lowering churn and ramping growth.**

**Annual subscriptions as a proportion of overall subscriptions shift wildly depending on your[ARPU](https://www.paddle.com/resources/average-revenue-per-user),** with low ARPU companies seeing over 50% of their subscriptions on annual plans, mid-range ARPU companies dropping down to roughly 20-30% of their subscription coming from annuals, and then high ARPU companies swinging back to a high proportion of annuals.

[![Annual Plans are Proportionally High for Low and High ARPU Products](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659c7c77531ac2845a273aab_GRAPH2.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

This feels pretty intuitive, because low ARPU companies have annual subscriptions that are nice round credit card numbers where a customer is more than willing to swipe for a $100 annual charge. On the high end, you’re likely looking at a mid-market or enterprise type deal, so an annual contract is simply baked into the sales cycle.

That being said, this is descriptive in nature, so what’s the data say around what works and what doesn’t? Well, annuals do reduce churn pretty substantially, because your customers have one purchasing decision per year versus twelve. Keeping track of your [**annual contract value (ACV**)](https://www.paddle.com/resources/annual-plans) closely and proactively reducing churn before it happens is key to maintaining a healthy business. 

As you can see in this data, there’s a strong correlation indicating that as you increase your annuals,**you’ll be reducing your churn with folks with the majority of their contracts as annuals seeing almost a fifth of the churn as those who don’t have annuals.**

[![Annual Contracts Greatly Reduce Churn](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659c7c76531ac2845a273aaa_GRAPH1.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Ultimately, more annuals are likely better, especially given the churn implications, so I’d push for optimizing those relationships by understanding where the best point to ask for an annual upgrade is within your customer’s lifecycle.

For most businesses, it’s probably not directly in the initial buying cycle, because your customer doesn’t know about your product quite yet, so some research absolutely needs to be done about your company specifically.

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,435 --> 00:00:09,715

What's up? It's Brendan.

4

00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:12,035

Quick question for you

on this fine morning.

5

00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:16,095

What portion of our subscription

should be monthly versus annual?

6

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,290

Thanks.

7

00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,090

Welcome back, everyone. Neil

here for the ProfitWell Report.

8

00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,810

The beauty of the subscription

model is that for the first

9

00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,030

time in the history of business,

10

00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:28,075

relationships are baked directly

into how you make money.

11

00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:29,595

Every month, year,

12

00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:32,395

or however long the term

of the subscription is,

13

00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:35,460

your customer has a decision

to make around if they're

14

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,380

receiving the value for

which they're paying.

15

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,260

If they don't feel like

they're getting value, then they churn.

16

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,995

If they do feel like they're

getting value, they'll renew.

17

00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:46,115

Having a longer term length or

an annual subscription can make

18

00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:49,075

this easier on you because the

customer is making a deeper

19

00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:52,030

commitment that allows you

to plead your value case with

20

00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,870

enough time to show value.

21

00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:59,045

Hence, why annuals can be instrumental

in lowering churn and ramping growth.

22

00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:03,045

To answer this, we looked at over two

and a half thousand subscription and

23

00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:04,085

SaaS companies.

24

00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:05,685

As to not bury the lead,

25

00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:08,000

annual subscriptions as

a proportion of overall

26

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,520

subscriptions shifts widely

depending on your ARPU with low

27

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,840

ARPU companies seeing over

fifty percent of their

28

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,875

subscriptions on annual plans,

29

00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,275

mid range ARPU companies

dropping down to roughly twenty

30

00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:20,675

to thirty percent of their

subscriptions coming from annuals,

31

00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:23,155

and high ARPU companies

swinging back to a high

32

00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:24,195

proportion of annuals.

33

00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:27,360

This feels pretty intuitive

because low ARPA companies have

34

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,480

annual subscriptions that are

nice round credit card numbers

35

00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,120

where a customer is more

willing to swipe for a hundred

36

00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,240

dollar annual charge.

37

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,215

On the high end,

38

00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:37,775

you're likely looking at a mid

market or enterprise type deal,

39

00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:40,655

so an annual contract is simply

baked into the sales cycle.

40

00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:43,080

That being said, this

is deceptive in nature.

41

00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,600

So what's the data say around

what works and what doesn't work?

42

00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,655

Well, annuals do reduce churn

pretty substantially because your

43

00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:53,695

customers have one purchasing

decision per year versus twelve.

44

00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:55,135

And as you see in this data,

45

00:01:55,135 --> 00:01:58,815

there's a strong correlation indicating

that as you increase your annuals,

46

00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:02,320

you'll be reducing your churn with folks

with the majority of their contracts'

47

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,880

annuals seeing almost a fifth

of their churn as those who

48

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,160

don't have annuals.

49

00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,005

Ultimately, more annuals

are likely better,

50

00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:10,845

especially given the

churn implications.

51

00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:14,365

So I push for

optimizing those relationships by understanding

52

00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:16,980

where the best point to ask

for an annual upgrade is within

53

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,180

your customer's life cycle.

54

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,380

For most businesses,

55

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,020

it's probably not directly

in the initial buying cycle

56

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,305

because your customer doesn't

know about your product quite yet.

57

00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:28,105

So your research absolutely needs

to be done about your

58

00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:29,545

company specifically.

59

00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:30,985

Well, that's all for now.

60

00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,105
