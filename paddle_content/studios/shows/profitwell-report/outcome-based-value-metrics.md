Value metrics are what you charge for - per user, per 100 videos, per something that theoretically aligns with where your customer ascribes value from your product. They’re the most effective pricing mechanism you can have in the subscription world, but not all value metrics are created equal.

On this episode of the ProfitWell Report, James Carbary, **[Founder at Sweet Fish Media and the B2B Growth Show](https://sweetfishmedia.com/)** , asks us about what value metrics are best for growth. To understand value metrics and which type you should be using, and of course to answer James’s question, we looked at nearly four thousand subscription companies across multiple industries.

#### Outcome-Based Value Metrics

It’s important to understand the impact of value metrics. When comparing companies who use a value metric to those who don’t, you’ll note that those utilizing value metrics are growing at nearly double the rate as those deploying strictly feature differentiation.

[![Comparing Growth by Pricing Model](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/ZpVOsR5LeNNTxKoO_ZjBmZjJmZWEtYWRiNS00Zjg3LWFjODEtOWMwNzY1MjM2MmRi_comparing20growth20by20pricing20model.jpeg?auto=format%2Ccompress%3Fauto%3Dcompress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

This is because when you’re using a value metric properly, your customer is only paying for their usage where they’re getting value from your product. If they use less, they pay less, so why would they [churn](https://www.paddle.com/resources/topic/churn-retention). If they use more, they pay more and don’t complain, because they’re getting value.

That being said, there are two types of value metrics - functional and outcome based. Functional value metrics are like per user or per 100 videos. Pricing scales around a function of usage. Outcome based value metrics are where you charge based on an outcome - like how many views a video received or how much money you made your customer.

When we look at the gross churn of companies using different models you’ll note that both types of value metrics outperform feature differentiation with up to 75% less churn, but the outcome based value metrics take this a step further with an additional 40% reduction in churn.

[![Outcome Value Metrics Drive Down Churn](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/ZpVOsh5LeNNTxKoP_MjkyMWE5NmQtNTQ3Ni00ZjhmLTgxNDYtY2MzNjAzNTBlMjZk_outcome20value20metrics20drive20down20churn.jpeg?auto=format%2Ccompress%3Fauto%3Dcompress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

When you think about the center of an outcome based value metric this make sense, because if you’re aligned towards an outcome, why would you churn if you still believe in that outcome as a customer.

This trend continues further when looking at expansion revenue. Both types of value metrics still outperform feature differentiated pricing models with at least 30% more expansion revenue, but outcome based value metrics push those gains to nearly 50%.

If I can give you more of the outcome you’re buying my product for, why wouldn’t you spend more with me.

Ultimately, value metrics are everything when it comes to properly pricing subscription products, because you're aligning your revenue model directly to where a customer interprets value from your product.

We all don’t have the luxury of pricing based on outcome though, because sometimes it’s hard to perfectly measure how much money someone gained from using your product or how much that time you saved them is worth. Yet, we can take a lesson from this data in making sure we get as close to that customer and as close to value as technically possible.

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:10,415

Hey, Patrick and

the ProfitWell team.

4

00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:11,615

My name is James Carberry.

5

00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:13,215

I'm the founder of

Sweet Fish Media,

6

00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:15,935

and I cohost a podcast

called b two b growth.

7

00:00:15,935 --> 00:00:20,450

I've been seeing a lot of talk

about value metrics lately.

8

00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,495

What are you seeing in terms

of their impact on growth?

9

00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:25,015

Thanks a lot, man.

10

00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:29,255

Value metrics are what you charge

for per user, per hundred videos,

11

00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:32,400

per something that

theoretically aligns with where

12

00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,200

your customer ascribes

value from your product.

13

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,720

They're the most impressive

and important pricing mechanism you

14

00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,795

can have in the

subscription world,

15

00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:43,995

but not all value metrics

are created equal.

16

00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:47,595

To understand value metrics and

which type you should be using

17

00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:49,200

and of course to answer

18

00:00:53,548 --> 00:00:54,648

When

19

00:00:58,575 --> 00:01:01,455

When comparing companies who

use a value metric to those who

20

00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:03,755

are simply using

feature differentiation,

21

00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:06,950

those with value metrics are

growing at double the rate as

22

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,330

those feature

differentiated counterparts.

23

00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,685

This is because when you're

using a value metric properly,

24

00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:16,285

your customer is only paying

for their usage of value.

25

00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,485

If they use less, they pay

less, so why would they churn?

26

00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:20,445

If they use more,

27

00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:24,320

they pay more and don't really

complain because they're getting value.

28

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,440

That being said though, there

are two types of value metrics.

29

00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,925

There's functional

and outcome based.

30

00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:33,845

Functional value metrics are like

per user or per hundred videos.

31

00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:36,885

Pricing scales around

a function of usage.

32

00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:39,660

Outcome based value metrics are

are where you charge based on

33

00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,940

some sort of outcome,

34

00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,220

like how many views a video

received or how much money you

35

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,265

made that particular customer.

36

00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:49,625

When we look at the gross churn of

companies using different models,

37

00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,505

you'll note that both types

of value metrics outperform

38

00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:55,385

feature differentiation

with at least seventy five

39

00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:56,970

percent less churn.

40

00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,690

But the outcome based value

metrics take this a step

41

00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,705

further with an additional forty

percent reduction in churn.

42

00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:06,425

When you think about the center

of an outcome based value

43

00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:07,945

metric, this makes sense.

44

00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:11,280

Because if you're aligned

towards that outcome,

45

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,520

why would you churn if you still

believed in that outcome as a customer?

46

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,960

This trend continues further when

looking at expansion revenue.

47

00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,865

Both types of value metrics

still outperform feature

48

00:02:21,865 --> 00:02:24,905

differentiated pricing models

with at least thirty percent

49

00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:26,505

more expansion revenue.

50

00:02:26,505 --> 00:02:30,600

But outcome based value metrics push

those gains to nearly fifty percent.

51

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,720

If I can give you more of

the outcome you're buying my

52

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,115

product for, why wouldn't

you spend more with me?

53

00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,875

Ultimately, value metrics are

everything when it comes to properly

54

00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,755

pricing subscription products

because you're aligning your

55

00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:48,690

revenue model directly to where customer

interprets value from your product.

56

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,730

We all don't have the luxury

of pricing based on an outcome

57

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,610

though because sometimes it's

hard to perfectly measure how

58

00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,625

much money someone gained from

using your product or how much

59

00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,585

time they saved and how

much that time is worth.

60

00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:04,105

Yet we can take a lesson from

the data and making sure we get

61

00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:09,260

as close to the customer and as close

to value as technically possible.

62

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,380

Well, that's all for now.

63

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,340
