_**Originally published: May 9, 2018**_

Value metrics increase [**ARPU** ](https://www.paddle.com/resources/average-revenue-per-user)across all-sized subscription companies including those in both B2B and B2C. As the data suggests, if you aren't using a value metric you're losing out on some of your key revenue growth potential.

On this episode of the ProfitWell Report, John Bonini, **[Director of Marketing at Databox](https://databox.com/)** asks us to look at how value metrics can drive higher ARPU (average revenue per user) at signup. To answer his question, let’s look at the data from just over 5,000 recurring revenue companies.

#### 

#### Value metrics' impact on ARPU

Love this question John - **[value metrics](https://www.paddle.com/blog/value-metrics-pricing)** as a lot of you know are one of my favorite topics in the world of recurring revenue and pricing. To answer your question, we looked at just over five thousand recurring revenue companies.

To get right to the point - value metrics are the most effective way for you to drive ARPU. A value metric is what you charge for - per user, per dashboards, per 100 visits, etc.

Those companies deploying a value metric tend to have much higher ARPUs than their feature differentiated counterparts in both B2B and B2C with each blended category seeing over 20% higher ARPU.

We’re seeing this trend, mainly because **[expansion revenue](https://www.paddle.com/resources/expansion-revenue)** is baked directly into the pricing model where as a customer consumes more and more of what you’re selling, he or she is more than happy to pay more.

In fact, when looking at expansion revenue based on pricing model, those companies deploying a value metric are seeing 40 to 100% higher expansion revenue as a percentage of their revenue than those simply using feature differentiation.

## 

#### Higher conversion rates at signup

So value metrics are great for ARPU and expansion revenue, but what about the signup element John asked us about? Well, value metrics are actually extremely useful for conversion.

Those individuals encountering a value metric based pricing model are also converting at a much higher rate.

[![Higher Conversion From Value Metric Based Pricing Models](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/ZTQ2N2EzNDEtY2JlYS00YTUwLWJkNmItZWIxZWViNmI5Mjcw_013-valumetric.006.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Across different ARPU levels, conversion rates for value metric models tend to be a minimum of 10% better with some interquartile ranges extending to nearly 40% higher.

That’s pretty impressive and the efficiency stems from greater flexibility in upgrading those users over time. You’re not trying to push the user up to a plan they aren’t ready for, because they’re presumably only getting charged for the value they’re using.

Plus, if you throw a free plan into the mix, then a user can be nurtured while using a low amount of your value metric until triggered through increased usage, indicating they’re ready to convert as a customer.

Ultimately, value metrics are the way to go, because they get right to the very root of the recurring revenue model, which is the relationship. If you price based on a value metric, you’re essentially creating a symbiotic relationship with your customer, giving them and charging them for exactly the amount of product they’re looking for - no more and no less.

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:11,855

Hey, Patrick. Loving the

ProfitWell Report so far.

4

00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:13,135

Keep up the great work.

5

00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:16,635

My question is around value

metrics and more specifically,

6

00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:20,480

how brands drive higher ARPU

at the point of sign up or how

7

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,920

they drive more value out of

free users or lower ARPU users.

8

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,795

Looking forward to your answer.

9

00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:27,335

Love this question, John.

10

00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:29,255

Value metrics, as

a lot of you know,

11

00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:32,295

are one of my favorite topics in

the world of recurring revenue.

12

00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:33,290

So to answer your question,

13

00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,490

we looked at just over five thousand

recurring revenue companies.

14

00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,530

To get right to the point,

15

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,250

value metrics are the most

effective way for you to drive

16

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,555

ARPU. A value metric

is what you charge for.

17

00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:45,995

It's per user, per

dashboard, per hundred visits, etcetera.

18

00:00:45,995 --> 00:00:48,315

Those companies deploying a value

metric tend to have a

19

00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,715

much higher ARPU than their

feature differentiated

20

00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:53,420

counterparts in both

b to b and b to c,

21

00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,100

with each blended category seeing

over twenty percent higher ARPU.

22

00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,900

We're seeing this trend mainly

because expansion revenue is

23

00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,205

baked directly into

the pricing model.

24

00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:04,685

Whereas a customer consumes

more and more of what you're

25

00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:07,965

selling, he or she is more

than happy to pay more.

26

00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:11,170

In fact, when looking at expansion

revenue based on pricing model,

27

00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,890

those companies deploying a

value metric are seeing forty

28

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,090

to a hundred percent higher

expansion revenue as percentage

29

00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,485

of their revenue than those simply

using feature differentiation.

30

00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:23,465

So value metrics are great for

ARPU and expansion revenue,

31

00:01:23,465 --> 00:01:26,350

but what about the sign up

element John asked us about?

32

00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,430

Well, value metrics are actually

extremely useful for conversion.

33

00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,390

Those individuals encountering

a value metric based pricing

34

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,535

model are also converting

at a much higher rate.

35

00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:37,975

Across different ARPU levels,

36

00:01:37,975 --> 00:01:40,535

conversion rates for value metric

models tend to be a

37

00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:43,815

minimum of ten percent better

with some interquartile ranges

38

00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:46,290

extending to nearly

forty percent higher.

39

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,410

That's pretty impressive,

40

00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,210

and the efficiency stems

from greater flexibility in

41

00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,130

upgrading those users over time.

42

00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,875

You're not trying to push the

user up to a plan they aren't

43

00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,675

ready for because they're

presumably only getting charged

44

00:01:57,675 --> 00:01:59,515

for the value that

they're using.

45

00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:01,435

Plus, if you throw a

free plan into the mix,

46

00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:04,050

then a user can be nurtured

while while using a low amount

47

00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,770

of your value metric until

triggered through increased

48

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,745

usage, indicating that they're

ready to convert as a customer.

49

00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:13,865

Ultimately, value metrics are the way

to go because they get right to the

50

00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:15,865

very root of the

recurring revenue model,

51

00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:17,465

which is the relationship.

52

00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:19,570

If you price based

on a value metric,

53

00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,330

you're essentially creating a symbiotic

relationship with your customer,

54

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,130

giving them and charging them

for the exact amount of product

55

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,355

that they need, no

more and no less.

56

00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:30,315

Well, that's all for now.

57

00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:31,195
