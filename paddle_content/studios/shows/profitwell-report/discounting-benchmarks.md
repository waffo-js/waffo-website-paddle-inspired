# How Discounts Impact Retention

In this episode of the ProfitWell Report, Patrick Campbell explores how discounts influence renewal and retention rates in subscription businesses, revealing that while discounts can accelerate sales, they often lead to increased churn and a devaluation of the product over time.

_**Originally published: April 4th, 2018**_

Discounting is a huge topic of interest in the subscription economy, primarily because most people don't know how to discount effectively. As the data suggests, using unnecessary discounts can have a real negative impact on your business.

On this episode of the ProfitWell Report, [**Olof Mathé of Mixmax**](https://mixmax.com/) asks us to dive into the data around [**discount pricing**](https://www.paddle.com/blog/discount-pricing). To answer his question, let’s look at the data from over 6,000 companies and 600,000 subscription consumers.

#### Affinity for discounting amongst sales teams

Discounts are a promotional pricing strategy seen as a virus within our current subscription community, not because they’re necessarily bad, but because we treat them like a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel.

To ease in here, let’s first look at the mindset of our sales and marketing teams. Just over seventy percent of practitioners believe that [**discounts**](https://www.paddle.com/blog/saas-discounting-strategy) should be used in some capacity to get customers to convert. On the flip side, less than ten percent of us believe that discounts should only be used as an absolute last resort.

[![Discount Preferences amongst sales teams](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/MjllOGUwMzUtNzYyMC00ZWJjLThkMDMtYzQxYmZjYTZhNDdi_pwreport-olofgraphsimages.002.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

This isn’t necessarily bad, but the level of discount we’re willing to give is startling. Just under eighty percent of respondents believe that the appropriate discount to give is over 25%.

[![Appropriate Discount Level Preferences](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/MjAyNTBhYTgtNDU1NS00ZGQxLTlkNzEtMTBlMmEzZWIwMDE4_pwreport-olofgraphsimages.003.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

You may be looking at these numbers and thinking this isn’t that shocking, but let’s lay this out for a second. Your price is the [**exchange rate on the value**](https://www.paddle.com/blog/value-based-pricing-strategy) you’re providing. Your sales and marketing team’s job is to justify that value to the prospect in order for them to convert at that value. Yet, Most of our sales and marketing teams are saying that in actuality, your value is only three fourths or worse. 

#### Discounting makes revenue growth unpredictable

Personally I don’t think we’re aware just how prevalent this phenomenon is within our businesses, because discounts do get us to our goal. When profiling companies who’ve reached their goals with discounts vs without discounts, you’ll note they both cross the finish line, but this success indicates an elementary understanding of [**unit economics**](https://www.paddle.com/resources/unit-economics).

[![Goal Progress Comparing Discounting Strategies](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/OThlM2IwMWMtZTU3Mi00OGJkLTgyMzctMDI3ZmJmNWJlN2Y4_pwreport-olofgraphsimages.004.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

In reality, these discounted customers have just over double the [**churn rate**](https://www.paddle.com/resources/calculate-churn-rate) as those who weren’t given a discount. When broken out by the level of discount you’ll notice a strong correlation of churn increasing as the discount level increases.

[![Discounted customers tend to churn at a higher rate](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/ZDdjNGZlYzYtYWIwMS00YTU5LWJkMjQtZDMwN2RmMzhlNzc1_pwreport-olofgraphsimages.005.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

#### Renewal willingness to pay goes down after discounts

These individuals have simply been trained to devalue the product or just weren’t the right customers in the first place. In fact if we strictly look an annual contracts and we look at the [**willingness to pay**](https://www.paddle.com/blog/price-sensitivity) of the customer at annual renewal compared to the discount level given at the original purchase, we see a dramatic drop off after the 30% discount mark in willingness to pay.

[![Discounting Impact on Renewal Willingness to Pay](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/M2Q5YmJmM2EtN2M2MC00OTA1LTkxMzktNDlmMmRkOTAxMmVl_pwreport-olofgraphsimages.006.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Yet, our teams think this is perfectly appropriate. We’re essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul where Peter is your customer success and product teams who gets dumped the problem of retention.

So should you not discount at all? No, that’s not what the data says, but you need to think about a discount as a scalpel - efficiently used as a catalyst to lower the activation energy of a prospect to get them to convert and see the true value of your product with expanded willingness to pay.

00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:03,870

You’ve got the questions and we have the

data.

2

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,140

Each week we dive deep on benchmarks of the

subscription economy that you just can’t

3

00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,060

get anywhere else.

4

00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,820

This is: The ProfitWell Report.

5

00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:22,160

Hey Patrick, Olof from MixMax here, I’m

super curious: how do discounts affect renewal

6

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160

and retention rates?

7

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,990

Loving that mixmax wallpaper, Olof.

8

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,880

So, let’s talk discounts.

9

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,050

To answer Olof’s question, we looked at

over six thousand companies and data from

10

00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,030

nearly six hundred thousand subscriber buyers.

11

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,320

Here’s what we found.

12

00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,340

Discounts are a virus within our current subscription

community, not because they’re necessarily

13

00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,290

bad, but because we treat them like a sledgehammer

instead of a scalpel.

14

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,739

To ease in here, let’s first look at the

mindset of our sales and marketing teams.

15

00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,149

Just over seventy percent of practitioners

believe that discounts should be used in some

16

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,290

capacity to get customers to convert.

17

00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,390

On the flip side, less than ten percent of

us believe that discounts should only be used

18

00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,020

as an absolute last resort.

19

00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:04,650

This isn’t necessarily bad, but the level

of discount we’re willing to give is startling.

20

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,040

Just under eighty percent of respondents believe

that the appropriate discount to give is over

21

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,040

25%.

22

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,850

You may be looking at these numbers and thinking

this isn’t that shocking, but let’s lay

23

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,340

this out for a second.

24

00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,930

Your price is the exchange rate on the value

you’re providing.

25

00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,689

Your sales and marketing team’s job is to

justify that value to the prospect in order

26

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,190

for them to convert at that value.

27

00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,990

Yet, Most of our sales and marketing teams

are saying that in actuality your value is

28

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,240

only three fourths or worse.

29

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,150

Personally I don’t think we’re aware just

how prevalent this phenomenon is within our

30

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,420

businesses, because discounts do get us to

our goal.

of unit economics.

34

00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,680

In reality, these discounted customers have

just over double the churn rate as those who

35

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,170

weren’t given a discount.

36

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,479

When broken out by the level of discount you’ll

notice a strong correlation of churn increasing

37

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,720

as the discount level increases.

38

00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,189

These individuals have simply been trained

to devalue the product or just weren’t the

39

00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,489

right customers in the first place.

40

00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:13,609

In fact if we strictly look an annual contracts

and we look at the willingness to pay of the

41

00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:19,010

customer at annual renewal compared to the

discount level given at the original purchase,

42

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,040

we see a dramatic drop off after the 30% discount

mark in willingness to pay.

43

teams who gets dumped the problem of retention.

46

00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,879

So should you not discount at all?

47

00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,620

No, that’s not what the data says, but you

need to think about a discount as a scalpel

00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:51,810
