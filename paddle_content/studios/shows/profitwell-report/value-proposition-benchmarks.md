In the Mad Men days of yore, sentiment would indicate that coming up with the right value proposition required a few steak dinners and plenty of martinis. In reality the data tells us the truth, namely using the right value proposition can have a big impact on your product.

On this episode of the ProfitWell Report, Ed Leake, Founder at AdEvolver asks us to look at the **[influence on willingness to pay](https://www.paddle.com/resources/willingness-to-pay)** that value propositions can have. To answer Ed's question, we looked at the willingness to pay data of nearly ten thousand different subscription consumers.

#### Value Propositions Influence Willingness to Pay

To get right to the point, the right value proposition absolutely influences willingness to pay, and a lot more than you’d intuitively think.

We tested a fake CRM product amongst different groups of sales leadership with decision making authority on sales teams with less than 10 sales people. When asking these same buyers about the same product, but leading with different messaging we saw varying willingness to pay. Note how focusing on sales efficiency and organizing the chaos won out handedly against propositions like accelerate your growth and see inside your whole team.

[![Different B2B value propositions resulted in differing WTP](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/ZjZiNTljNzQtNjE2YS00YmE1LWEwNjYtNzA2NDYzZjdkYjFm_graph1-different20b2b20value20propositions20resulted20in20differing20wtp20-20mid20low20high20graph-marketing.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Remember this was the same product with the same description, the only piece we changed was the value proposition of the page, which resulted in increasing willingness to pay by 15-30%, which is no small amount at scale.

#### B2C Value Propositions Are Just as Important

Interestingly enough, these trends are similar in the B2C market, as well. When testing the willingness to pay for a fake fitness app, consumers resonated with the concept of keeping their fitness consistent and achieving their goals while sentiments around losing weight and getting healthy scored poorly. Again though, the swings are pretty dramatic.

Mindset matters when priming your buyers to make a purchasing decision, which is the very definition as to why product marketing exists as a function within your organization. You need to know what your buyers are thinking and ultimately need to make sure you get to a point of position, packaging, and pricing fit to ensure you align your entire funnel around that which will make conversion smooth and willingness to pay maximized.

All data indicates - **[value propositions](https://www.paddle.com/blog/value-propositions)** have a big hand in that experience.

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:09,335

Hi, guys.

4

00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:13,715

Ed Leake here from Midas Media

and founder of Adevolva dot com.

5

00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:16,090

Love the pricing tear

teardown videos, by the way.

6

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,050

Got a question for you.

7

00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,710

Do you think that,

8

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,950

value propositions affect a

customer's willingness to pay?

9

00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:23,610

Oh, Ed.

10

00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,495

This is a fascinating question

because in the mad men days of yours,

11

00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:29,975

sentiment would indicate that

coming up with the right value

12

00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:33,540

proposition required a few steak

dinners and plenty of martinis.

13

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,380

In reality, the data

tells us the truth.

14

00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,580

So to answer your question,

15

00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,220

we looked at the willingness to

pay data of nearly ten thousand

16

00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,025

different subscription consumers,

and here's what we found.

17

00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:43,065

To get right to the point,

18

00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:46,105

the right value proposition

absolutely influences

19

00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:49,380

willingness to pay and a lot more

than you'd intuitively think.

20

00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,340

We tested a fake CRM product

amongst different groups of

21

00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,220

sales leadership with decision

making authority on teams of

22

00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,535

less than ten people.

23

00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:59,495

And when asking these same

buyers about the same product,

24

00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:01,095

but leading with a

different message,

25

00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:03,335

we saw varying

willingness to pay.

26

00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:06,290

Note how focusing on sales

efficiency and organizing the

27

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,650

chaos won out handedly against

propositions like accelerate

28

00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,690

your growth and see inside

your whole sales team.

29

00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,425

Remember, this was the same

product with the same features,

30

00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:19,025

but the only piece we changed was

the value proposition of the page,

31

00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:21,665

which resulted in increasing

willingness to pay by fifteen

32

00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:25,320

to thirty percent, which is

no small amount at scale.

33

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,120

Interestingly enough,

34

00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,760

these trends are similar in

the b to c market as well.

35

00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,480

When we tested willingness to

pay for a fake fitness app,

36

00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,800

consumers resonated with

the concept of keeping their

37

00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,945

fitness consistent in

achieving their goals,

38

00:01:35,945 --> 00:01:38,745

while sentiments around losing

weight and getting healthy

39

00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:40,585

ironically scored poorly.

40

00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:43,845

Again, the swings were

nothing less but dramatic.

41

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,390

Mindset matters when priming

your buyers to make a

42

00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,670

purchasing decision which

is the very reason as to why

43

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,025

product marketing

exists as a function.

44

00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:53,945

You need to know what your

buyers are thinking and

45

00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:56,105

ultimately need to make

sure you get to a point of

46

00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:57,545

positioning, packaging,

47

00:01:57,545 --> 00:02:01,400

and pricing fit to ensure you

align your entire funnel around

48

00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,880

that which will make your

conversion smooth and

49

00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,720

willingness to pay maximized.

50

00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,805

All data indicates value propositions

have a big hand in that experience.

51

00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:11,865

Well, that's all for now.

52

00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,665
