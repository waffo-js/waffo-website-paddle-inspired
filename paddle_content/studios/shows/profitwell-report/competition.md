# Should You Focus on Your Competition?

On this episode of the ProfitWell Report, we're focusing on whether competition is good or bad for the growth of a business. Well, after studying two and a half thousand subscription companies, we're excited to share what we found.

“Focus on your customers, don’t even think about the competition.” I've heard this piece of advice consistently for the past decade. Yet, when I ask why, the responses are typically pretty lukewarm and appeal to a time of tech company past when there were only a few companies in existence for each space.

What’s the data actually say?

But first, if you like this kind of content and want to learn more, **[subscribe to get in the know](https://share.hsforms.com/17xcsifdtRi2xXbSPvncQow2fzi5)** when we release new episodes.

First, let's talk about the rise in competition in the subscription space.

When surveying founders and executives around how many competitors they had in their first year of business, we find that those who started their businesses five years ago were looking at two to three competitors, whereas those starting a year ago were looking at double digit competitors.

[![Number of Competitors in First Year in Business](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659ca3a3531ac2845a273b3a_Graph1-5.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

So should we focus on all this new competition?

When we explore marketing data, it turns out some level of competitive focus does work. **[Customer acquisition cost or CAC](https://www.paddle.com/resources/customer-acquisition-cost)** is roughly 15% lower for companies with a competitive focus, which includes **[comparison pages](https://wpdatatables.com/product-comparison/)** , competitive ads, and the like.

[![CAC Lower Amongst Competition Focused Companies](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659ca3b6531ac2845a273b3b_Graph2-3.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

When done well, the data suggests that competitive comparisons can actually help buyers make a decision, because they’re already doing research in a competitive market. So it stands to reason that you should help them with their research and respectfully show the differences between you and your competitors.

However, we haven't approached the question from all appropriate angles yet. **Product is a whole different issue** , where those **companies with a competitive product strategy are actually doing worse from a customer satisfaction perspective,** as measured through net promoter score.

[![NPS is Lower for Competitor Focused Product Teams](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659ca3c7531ac2845a273b3d_Graph3-1.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

**These competitive focused product teams are seeing roughly 50% lower NPS scores compared to their non-competitive focused counterparts,** and note that this trend has remained consistent over the past number of years.

So should you focus on your competition?

Well, it’s hard to say. You never want to do anything that sacrifices product quality, and the data suggests that these companies who are focused on competition presumably are good at lowering their CAC, but not so great at defending their NPS.

Another possible outcome here is these companies aren’t disciplined enough to focus on competition in the right places and ignore the competition in the other places.

Like most cliches then this comes down to your situation and your discipline.

That's all for this week. Want to learn more?

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,755 --> 00:00:09,715

Hey, Neil.

4

00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:12,515

Landon here, cofounder of

User Feed and Ad Reform.

5

00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:14,410

Just had a quick

question for you.

6

00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,890

Should you focus on

your competitors?

7

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,290

Thanks. Focus on your customers.

8

00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,585

Don't even think

about the competition.

9

00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:22,225

Being in product,

10

00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:25,185

I've heard this advice consistently

for the past couple years.

11

00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:26,785

Yet when I dig into why,

12

00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:29,585

the responses are pretty

lukewarm and appeal to a time

13

00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:32,730

of tech companies past when

there were only a few companies

14

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,970

in existence for each space.

15

00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,530

What does the data actually say?

16

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,065

Well, to answer this

question around competition,

17

00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:43,265

we're gonna look at two and a half

thousand subscription companies.

18

00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:46,545

Denying competition has

increased is a fool's errand.

19

00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:49,450

When surveying executives

and founders around how many

20

00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,370

competitors they had in

their first year of business,

21

00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,930

we find that those who started

their business five years ago

22

00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,690

were looking at two

to three competitors,

23

00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,895

where as those that started a

year ago were looking at double

24

00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:00,175

digit competitors.

25

00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:02,815

The rise in competition though

doesn't mean that you shouldn't

26

00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:04,475

focus on competition.

27

00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,260

Yet, when we explore

marketing data,

28

00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,180

it turns out that some level of

competitive focus does in fact work.

29

00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,265

Customer acquisition cost or

CAC is roughly fifteen percent

30

00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:15,585

lower for companies with

a competitive focus,

31

00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:19,105

which includes comparison pages,

competitive ads, and the like.

32

00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:22,550

When done well, the data suggests

that competitive comparisons can

33

00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,870

actually help buyers

make a decision.

34

00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,110

Right?

35

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,150

Because they're already doing

research in a competitive market,

36

00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,455

so it stands to reason that

you should help them with the

37

00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:33,175

research and respectfully show

the differences between you and

38

00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:34,435

your competitors.

39

00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:36,855

Product is a whole

different issue though,

40

00:01:36,855 --> 00:01:39,415

where those companies with

a competitive product strategy

41

00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:42,400

are actually doing worse

from a customer satisfaction

42

00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,800

perspective when measured

through Net Pro order score.

43

00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,280

These competitive focused

product teams are seeing

44

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,425

roughly fifty percent lower NPS

scores compared to their non

45

00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:52,325

competitive focused

counterparts.

46

00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:54,985

And note that this trend

has actually remained fairly

47

00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:57,350

consistent over the

past number of years.

48

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,010

So should you focus

on your competition?

49

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,270

Well, it's hard to say. Right?

50

00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,230

You never wanna do anything

that sacrifices product quality,

51

00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,665

and and the data does suggest

that these companies who are

52

00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:10,705

focused on competition are

presumably good at lowering

53

00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:14,250

their CAC, but not so great

at defending their NPS.

54

00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,650

Another possible outcome here

is that these companies aren't

55

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,250

disciplined enough to focus on

competition in the right places

56

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,190

and ignore competition

in the other places.

57

00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:24,885

Like most cliches,

58

00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:28,005

this comes down to the

situation and your discipline.

59

00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:29,285

Well, that's all for now.

60

00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:30,245

If you have a question,

61

00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:33,190
