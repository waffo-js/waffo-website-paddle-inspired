_**Originally published: February 6, 2019**_

Work life balance is both a controversial and exceptionally in vogue topic to discuss with some founders saying you need to hustle your face off and give up everything to succeed. Others tell you that you should have hobbies, you shouldn’t give your life up to your work, and you need to pace yourself.

**While both may be true or false, what bothers me about this debate is the lack of any real data.**

Let’s first come at this from the angle of hobbies, which are a pretty good proxy for the approach to work life balance. Turns out those **companies who have a founder who has a hobby that takes up more than 10 hours of their week are growing at roughly a 20% slower rate than those who don’t have a significant hobby.**

[![Companies with Founders with a Hobby Grow Slower](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cccab531ac2845a273bd6_GRAPH1.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

There are a lot of lurking variables here, so we also codified the founder’s approach to work life balance through a number of questions around tradeoffs, hours spent working per week, and the like.

Those who scored highly on our index have a doctrine of work life balance at their companies, compared to those who scored low who are all-in. **The all-in folks are growing at nearly double the rate as those who are more conscious to work-life balance.** Perhaps most telling, this relationship has remained fairly consistent over the past six years.

So what does this mean for your business? Well, it’s easy to look at this and say work life balance founders are wrong, but keep in mind **there’s a price to being all-in, especially when it comes to your health.**

Yet, maybe that’s the cost of doing something great, you have to tradeoff something to dedicate all that time and effort to growth.

Time will tell and more research absolutely needs to be done here, but I find respite in this debate being less about growth and more out of what you want out of your adventures in growth. Knowing that allows you to understand and commit to the tradeoffs.

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:11,815

This is Max with ThriveHive, and

my question for you today is,

4

00:00:11,815 --> 00:00:14,375

how do you think work life

balance affects a company's

5

00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,195

performance and growth?

6

00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,900

Work life balance is both a

controversial and exceptionally

7

00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,660

invoked topic to discuss.

8

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,220

With some founders saying that

you need to hustle your face

9

00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,885

off and give up

everything to succeed.

10

00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:28,565

Others saying that you

should have hobbies,

11

00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:30,565

that you shouldn't give

your life up to your work,

12

00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:32,120

and that you need

to pace yourself.

13

00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,880

While both may be true or false,

14

00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,320

what bothers me most about this

debate is the lack of any real data.

15

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,440

To answer this question,

16

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,000

we're gonna look at the growth

rates of just under four

17

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,235

hundred companies across a

myriad of spaces in the context

18

00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:47,515

of how their founders approach

work life balance and hobbies.

19

00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:49,700

Let's first come at this

from the angle of hobbies,

20

00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,980

which are pretty good proxy for

the approach to work life balance.

21

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,420

Turns out, those companies who

have a founder who has a hobby that

22

00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,965

takes up more than ten hours

of their week are growing at

23

00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:01,925

roughly a twenty percent slower

rate than those who don't have

24

00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:03,525

a significant hobby.

25

00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:04,245

That's crazy.

26

00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:06,005

There are a lot of

lurking variables here,

27

00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:09,290

so we've codified the founder's

approach to work life balance

28

00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,770

through a number of

questions around trade offs,

29

00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,170

hours spent working

per week, and the like.

30

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,255

Those who scored highly on our

index have a doctrine of work

31

00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:20,135

life balance at their companies

compared to those who scored

32

00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:21,815

low who are all in.

33

00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,615

The all in folks are growing

at nearly double the rate at those

34

00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:26,570

who are more conscious

to work life balance.

35

00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,850

Perhaps most telling,

36

00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,450

this relationship has remained fairly

consistent over the past six years.

37

00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,910

So what does this mean

for your business?

38

00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:37,475

Well, it's easy to look at this and say

work life balance founders are wrong.

39

00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:40,195

But keep in mind, there's

a price to being all in,

40

00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:41,880

especially when it

comes to your health.

41

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,520

Yet, maybe that's just the

cost of doing something great.

42

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,240

You have to trade off something

to dedicate all that time and

43

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,120

effort to growth.

44

00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,625

Time will tell and more research

absolutely needs to be done here,

45

00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,985

But I find respite in this

debate being less about growth

46

00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:57,945

and more about what you want out

of your adventures in growth.

47

00:01:57,945 --> 00:02:00,320

Knowing that allows you to

understand and commit to the

48

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,520

trade offs required.

49

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,120

Well, that's all for now.

50

00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,160
