#### Main Takeaways:

  * Cosmetic localization correlates to 30-45% higher growth rates than non-localized pricing. 
  * Market-based localization results in double the growth rates of non-localized pricing
  * Nordic consumers are typically willing to pay 25-30% more than US consumers
  * Consumers in the UK have 15-20% higher willingness to pay than the US

To get right to the point, localizing and internationalizing your pricing is a quick win with significant growth dividends.

There are two types of localization - cosmetic localization and market-based localization.

Cosmetic Localization involves simply making sure the currency symbol of your price matches the currency of the buyer within their location - a buyer in France sees Euros, a buyer in the US sees dollars.

Simply cosmetically **[localizing your pricing](https://www.paddle.com/blog/saas-localized-pricing)** correlates to 30 to 45% higher growth on a relative basis compared to simply putting all of your prices in the same currency. This is because people want to buy in their own currency and trust their own currency more than others.

#### Localization Correlates with More Growth

Interestingly enough, the best companies are taking localization to the next level with **[market based localization](https://www.paddle.com/blog/price-localization)** , which means actually measuring the willingness to pay in each region and charging accordingly. Buyers in France would pay the equivalent of $150, and those in the US may be paying only $100.

Companies that are using market-based localization are seeing nearly double the growth than their non-localized counterparts. This happens because even in a globalized world, each market is different with different densities, competitive environments, and the like.

On a generalized basis, relative to the U.S, the Nordics are typically willing to pay 25-30% more, the UK 15-20% more, and generalized Southeast Asia willing to pay 30 to 45% less. These differentials are an enormous opportunity for **[ARPU](https://www.paddle.com/resources/average-revenue-per-user)** and volume.

#### Consumers in Different Regions have Different WTP

[![Consumers in Different Regions have Different WTP](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659c70f5531ac2845a2739fa_LOCALIZE3.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Great pricing comes down to **[understanding your buyers](https://www.paddle.com/blog/quantify-buyer-personas)** and utilizing that understanding to properly price those profiles accordingly. Localizing your pricing is an extremely quick win that every company should at least be doing at the cosmetic level.

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,060

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,240

Each week,

3

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,440

we dive deep on benchmarks

of the subscription economy that

4

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,375

you just can't get any else?

5

00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:13,375

This is the profit well report.

6

00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:18,210

Hey, Patrick. From Runkeeper

here. Coming coming at you

7

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,010

from, down the street

in Boston, actually at Boston

8

00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,145

Harbor, original site of the

Boston tea party? I'm curious.

9

00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:28,825

How does, localization impact

growth and willingness to pay?

10

00:00:28,825 --> 00:00:31,385

Thanks. John's starting

another revolution here.

11

00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:33,880

This is one of my favorite

and topics and pricing.

12

00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,160

So to answer John's question,

13

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,800

we looked at just

over fifteen hundred subscription companies

14

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,280

and nearly a million different

consumers. Here's what we

15

00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,255

found. To get

right to the point,

16

00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:44,895

localizing internationalizing your pricing

is a quick win

17

00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:46,575

with significant

growth dividends.

18

00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:48,335

There are two types

of localization,

19

00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:51,370

cosmetic localization and

market based localization.

20

00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,250

Cosmetric localization involves

simply making the currency

21

00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,090

symbol of your price match the

currency of the buyer within their location.

22

00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,765

So a buyer in France would see

euros and a buyer in the United

23

00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:01,805

States would see dollars.

24

00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:04,525

Turns out simply cosmetically

localizing your pricing

25

00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:07,325

correlates to thirty to forty

five percent higher growth on a

26

00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:09,730

relative basis compared to

simply putting all of your

27

00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,330

prices in the same currency.

28

00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,810

This is because people wanna

buy in their own currency and

29

00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,175

trust their own currency

more than others.

30

00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:17,135

Interestingly enough,

31

00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:20,095

the best companies are taking

localization to the next level

32

00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:22,015

with market based localization,

33

00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,630

which means actually measuring

the willingness to in each

34

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,630

region and charging

accordingly.

35

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,550

Buyers in France would be

paying the equivalent of a

36

00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,125

hundred and fifty dollars while those in

the US would be a hundred dollars.

37

00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,005

Companies that are using

market based localization are seeing

38

00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:37,325

nearly double the growth

in their non localized

39

00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:40,050

counterparts. This happens because

even in a globalized

40

00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,530

world, each market is different

with different densities,

41

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,610

competitive environments,

and the like.

42

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,850

On a generalized basis,

relative to the US,

43

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,730

the Nordics are willing to pay

twenty five to thirty percent more.

44

00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,195

The UK fifteen to

twenty percent and generalized

45

00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,315

Southeast Asia willing to pay

thirty to forty five percent less.

46

00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,035

This shows us an enormous

opportunity not only for higher

47

00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,250

r but also higher volume

in certain regions.

48

00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,970

Great pricing comes down

to understanding your buyers and

49

00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,865

utilizing that understanding to

properly price those files accordingly.

50

00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:10,905

Localizing your pricing is an

extremely quick win that every

51

00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:13,465

company should do at least

at the cosmetic level. Well,

52

00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:15,225

that's all for now. If

you have a question,
