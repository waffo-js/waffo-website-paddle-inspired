# What is Customer Research?

On today's episode of ProfitWell Report, we studied just over 3,000 recurring revenue companies and 1.2 million consumers to provide benchmarks on customer research and whether it still matters today.

Customer research has ebbed and flowed throughout the years, so how important is it today? As the data suggests, it's more important than ever to do customer research in order to build the right valuable features and avoid building the wrong product.

On this episode of the ProfitWell Report, Adam Blake, CMO at ThriveHive asks us to look at the current state of customer research and whether it still matters. To answer Adam’s question, we looked at just over 3,000 subscription companies and over 1.2 million different subscription consumers

#### What is Customer Research?

Customer research is exploratory research a company or industry conducts in order to identify customer segments and opportunity, as well as consumer behavior and needs. Customer research can be as broad or specific as you wish, focusing on a big demographic or a small customer segment.

#### Not Enough Customer Research

To not bury the lede - yes, customer research matters more than ever, but no one seems to care, which is sad.

If you ask any luminary of Silicon Valley for the one lesson that matters, most will espouse the importance of focusing on the customer. Paul Graham, Gail Goodman, Steve Blank, Mary Meeker - all of them advocate for the customer.

Yet, no one’s really following their sage advice. Executives indicate that 7 out of 10 of their organizations are speaking to less than 10 prospects or customers in a non-sales research capacity per month and note this doesn’t get better with a company’s size.

[![We're Not Talking to Our Customers in a Research Capacity](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/YTM2N2JjODMtYTA0YS00MzAyLTk0MjEtM2U0NjlkZDQ4ZDJh_graph12003b003b023b04.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

#### Not Enough Testing

Subscription and SaaS executives love to tell me they don’t do customer research but by God, they love to A/B and multivariate test their way to success. Hill climbing problems aside, in reality, we’re not doing tests either. Nearly half of us are not even conducting 1 test per month and this includes marketing tests and other **[product experimentation](https://www.hotjar.com/product-experimentation/tools/)** tests.

[![We're Not Running A/B or Multivariate Tests](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/NjBmNTIwZTQtMjFmNC00MTA5LTk2MjYtMzQ2ZTQ5MThlNTIz_graph22003b003b003b00.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Put simply, we love to retweet articles about customer research, we love to give advice to people about customer research - but we’re not doing customer research - and that makes me die a little bit inside, because this lack of customer research is forcing us to build the wrong product.

#### We're Building the Wrong Product

We asked just over 2,500 product leaders to plot the last N features they built on a value matrix - which cross references how much companies care about a particular feature compared to other features with how much they’re willing to pay for features. In turn, this shows us what types of features we’re putting out - be it core features, add-ons, or just plain trash.

[![A Value Matrix Example](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/YjBjN2MzYzktOGZkMS00MDNlLWE0MGYtNjIyOGI0NGZjOWRm_visual4.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

This is what your product leaders indicated they’re building for the last five thousand features they built. A lot of differentiable and valuable features.

[![What We Think We're Building](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/NmZiMmEwZTUtMWU2NS00MWY0LThmNjYtNzQxODdiY2VmMWRj_graph4.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

We then went out and asked 1.2 million different customers about their actual willingness to pay and their actual preference for features using our statistical models, and this is what they indicated you’re actually building.

[![What We're Actually Building](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/NTY5OGMwNDgtMjQwOC00NWM4LTg1OWItOGI4MjFjNzg3ZGM3_graph5.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080&w=3840&fit=max)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Essentially your product teams are extremely confident they’re building value when in reality they aren’t and they don’t even know they’re doing this, because you’re not talking to your customers.

As **[CAC](https://www.paddle.com/resources/customer-acquisition-cost)** increases, the relative value of features declines, and growing a business just becomes that much harder, we’re in a world where we’ve literally been given the answer to success - understanding our customer - not always agreeing, but at least understanding, and for the most part we’ve turned our noses up at the notion of actually talking to the people that are ultimately paying us. That’s a scary thought.

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,440

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:11,655

Hey, Patrick. Adam

here from ThriveHive.

4

00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:15,255

So my question is, does customer

research matter anymore?

5

00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:17,040

Does anybody care?

6

00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,440

This is a great question

because customer research has

7

00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,200

ebbed and flowed

throughout the years.

8

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,480

So to answer Adam's question,

9

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,120

we looked at just over three

thousand subscription companies

10

00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,605

and over one point two

million different subscription

11

00:00:27,605 --> 00:00:29,685

consumers, and

here's what we found.

12

00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:31,045

To not bury the lead, yes,

13

00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:34,085

customer research

matters more than ever,

14

00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:36,410

but none of us seem

to care, which is sad.

15

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,370

And if you ask any luminary

of Silicon Valley for the one

16

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,490

lesson that matters,

17

00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,025

most will spout the importance

of focusing on the customer.

18

00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:46,425

Paul Graham, Steve

Blank, Gail Goodman,

19

00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:49,785

all of them advocate for

focusing on that customer.

20

00:00:49,785 --> 00:00:53,470

Yet, no one's really

following their sage advice.

21

00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,790

Executives indicate that

seven out of ten of their

22

00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,750

organizations are speaking

to less than ten prospects or

23

00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,035

customers in a non sales

research capacity per month.

24

00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:05,315

And note, this doesn't really

get better with a company size.

25

00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,875

Subscription and SaaS

executives love to tell me then

26

00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,760

that they don't do Nearly

27

00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:13,823

half

28

00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:21,025

Nearly half of us aren't even

running one test per month and

29

00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:22,945

this includes marketing tests.

30

00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:26,840

Put simply, we love to retweet

articles about customer research.

31

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,640

We love to give advice to

people about customer research,

32

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,520

but we're not doing customer

research and that makes me die

33

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,445

a little bit inside because

this lack of customer research

34

00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:38,005

is forcing us to build

the wrong product.

35

00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:40,805

We asked just over twenty five

hundred product leaders to plot

36

00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:43,870

the last n features they

built on a value matrix,

37

00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,190

which cross references how

much companies care about a

38

00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,470

particular feature compared to

other features with how much

39

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,305

they're willing to

pay for features.

40

00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:54,345

In turn, this shows us what type of

features you're actually building.

41

00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:57,785

Core features, add ons,

or just plain trash.

42

00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,265

This is what your

product leaders indicated they're

43

00:02:00,265 --> 00:02:03,130

building for the last five

thousand features they built.

44

00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,010

A lot of differentiable

and valuable features.

45

00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,370

Yet, we then went out and asked

one point two million different

46

00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,765

customers about how their

actual willingness to pay and

47

00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:14,645

their actual preferences for

features looked like using our

48

00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:15,845

statistical models,

49

00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:19,265

and this is what they indicated

you're actually building.

50

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,080

Essentially, your product teams

are extremely confident they're

51

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,520

building value when in reality

they aren't and they don't even

52

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,985

know they're doing this because

you're not talking to their customers.

53

00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:31,105

As CAC increases,

54

00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:33,985

the relative value of features

declines and growing a business

55

00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:35,750

just becomes that much harder.

56

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,710

We're in a world where we've

literally been given the answer

57

00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,430

to success, understanding

your customer,

58

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,710

not always agreeing with them,

59

00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,505

but at least understanding them.

60

00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:45,305

And for the most part,

61

00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:47,785

we've turned up our noses at

the very notion of actually

62

00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:50,665

talking to the people who

are ultimately paying us.

63

00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:52,985

And that's a scary thought.

Well, that's all for now.

64

00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:53,945

If you have a question,

65

00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:56,770
