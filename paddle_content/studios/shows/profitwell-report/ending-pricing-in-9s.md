On this episode of the ProfitWell Report, **[Ria Lao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rialao)** , Founder and CEO at **[GroupStar](https://www.groupstar.io/)** , has a fascinating question that you've probably thought of at some point: Should you end your subscription price in 9?

One of these tricks is to end your prices in 9 rather than a 0 or a 5. It’s a **[tactic used in retail products](https://www.smartinsights.com/marketing-planning/marketing-strategy/12-ways-can-use-psychology-marketing)** and environments, so it stands to reason that it may work in the subscription and SaaS worlds.

So to answer this week’s question, we designed a pricing experiment with just over ten thousand potential buyers. 

But first, if you like this kind of content and want to learn more, **[subscribe to get in the know](https://share.hsforms.com/17xcsifdtRi2xXbSPvncQow2fzi5)** when we release new episodes.

The theory behind ending your prices in a 9 actually stems from a J.C. Penney study that was done in the early 1900s in their stores.

They determined that when someone saw a price that ended in 7, 8, or 9 there seemed to be a feeling that they were getting a deal and this created a level of urgency that then pushed them to buy.

As the research expanded over the years, economists essentially found that if you wanted to be perceived as a luxury good you ended your prices in 5 or 0 and if you were more of a discount good or wanted to be perceived as a deal, you’d end your prices in a 7, 8, or 9.

**Walk into any luxury jewelry store and you’ll see all fives and zeros.** Luxury discount companies like Gilt Groupe will also show all before prices with fives and zeros, and all after prices in "7"s, "8"s, or "9"s.

In software, data indicates that ending your prices in 9s does help some sectors of the market, so we designed an experiment where we measured qualified conversion of the same product when the prices ended in 0 and then compared to the same product when the price was simply ending in 9.

What you’ll notice in the data is that **conversion tends to be 15 to 20% higher for lower ARPU products** , those that are selling for less than $200 per month in particular.

[![Ending Prices in "9"s Increases Conversion of Lower ARPU Products](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/ZqAItR5LeNNTxb4h_YzExNzJkOTItMTE4MS00MTlkLWIyYTgtNmIzMTFkZGQxZDU2_graph2-2.jpeg?auto=format%2Ccompress%3Fauto%3Dcompress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

As you get over that dollar amount this conversion power starts to diminish and basically trends to 0 with some natural variation, especially when you get into products over five thousand dollars per month.

So you should probably just end your prices in "9"s if you’re lower ARPU right? Well, not exactly. **The problem comes into play when you’re looking at conversion.**

We didn’t have a ton of data on this, because not a lot of companies have tested this tactic, but when comparing customers who converted with a 0 based price versus those with a "9"s based price, you’ll notice that the **"0"s have roughly 10% better net retention than those who converted with a 9 based price.**

[![Cosmetic Pricing Impacts Retention](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/ZqAIth5LeNNTxb4i_ZjQxZGY2NzUtOWUyYy00N2Y5LTg0YTItYmJhNTE1NmY5M2Rk_graph1-2.jpeg?auto=format%2Ccompress%3Fauto%3Dcompress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Why is this happening? Well, keep in mind that the individuals converting from a 9 based price are feeling like they’re getting a discount, and long time viewers of the show know that **discounted customers tend not to be the best customers for[lifetime value](https://www.paddle.com/resources/ltv-cac-model) and retention.**

When you’re doing a 9 based price in a retail product, you don’t necessarily care as much about the repeat purchase, because you’re just trying to spur that one time purchase. It’s not like they’re buying that coat as a subscription.

So what should you do? Well, this is something you need to test in your business individually unfortunately. There isn’t a very clear heuristic, but keep in mind that if your monetization strategy is terrible, this type of tactic is not going to save you at all.

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:11,025

Hey, Neil. This is

Ria, CEO of GroupStar.

4

00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:14,385

I wanna know, should you end your

subscription prices in nines?

5

00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:17,570

What's up, everyone? Neil here

for the ProfitWell Report.

6

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,330

When it comes to monetization,

7

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,130

there's an importance of getting

your central strategy right.

8

00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,135

And then once that's done or

even directionally correct,

9

00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:27,695

there are a whole myriad of

tactics you can use in order to

10

00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,115

boost conversion.

11

00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:32,255

One of these tricks is to end

your prices in nines rather

12

00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:33,930

than a zero or a five.

13

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,490

It's a tactic used in retail

products and environments,

14

00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,250

so it stands to reason that it may work

in the subscription and SaaS worlds.

15

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,770

So to answer this

week's question,

16

00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,225

we designed a pricing

experiment with just over ten

17

00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:45,745

thousand potential buyers.

18

00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,105

Here's what we found.

19

00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:50,385

The theory behind ending your

prices in a nine actually stems

20

00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:53,340

from a JCPenney study that

was done in the early nineteen

21

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,160

hundreds in their stores.

22

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,580

They determined that when

someone saw a price that ended

23

00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,015

in a seven, eight, or nine,

24

00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:01,495

there seemed to be a feeling

that they were getting a deal,

25

00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,615

or this created a level of

urgency that pushed them to buy.

26

00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:06,455

As the research

expanded over the years,

27

00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:09,270

economists essentially found

that if you wanted to be

28

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,030

perceived as a luxury good,

29

00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,270

you end your prices

in a five or a zero.

30

00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,875

And if you were more of a

discount good and you wanted to

31

00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:19,555

be perceived as a deal, you'd end your

prices in a seven, eight, or nine.

32

00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:21,315

Walk into any luxury

jewelry store,

33

00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,715

and you'll see all

fives and zeros.

34

00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:26,470

Luxury discount companies

like Guild Group will show all

35

00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,070

before prices in fives and

zeros and all after prices in

36

00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,670

seven, eight, or nines.

37

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,675

In software, data indicates that ending

your prices in nine does help some

38

00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:36,715

sectors of the market.

39

00:01:36,715 --> 00:01:39,115

We designed an experiment

where we measured qualified

40

00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:41,355

conversion of the same product

when the price had ended in

41

00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:44,440

zero and then compared to the

same product when the price was

42

00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,120

simply ending in nine.

43

00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,840

What you'll notice in the data

is that the conversion tends to

44

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,355

be fifteen to twenty percent

higher for lower ARPU products,

45

00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:54,755

those that are selling for less

than two hundred dollars per

46

00:01:54,755 --> 00:01:56,335

month in particular.

47

00:01:56,355 --> 00:01:57,795

As you get over

that dollar amount,

48

00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:59,690

this conversion power power

starts to diminish and

49

00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,570

basically turns to zero

with some natural variation,

50

00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,810

especially when you get into

products over five thousand

51

00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,985

dollars per month.

52

00:02:05,985 --> 00:02:10,145

So should you probably just end your

prices in nines if you're lower ARPU?

53

00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:11,585

Well, not exactly.

54

00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:14,605

The problem comes into play when

you're looking at conversion.

55

00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,950

We didn't have a ton of data

on this because not a lot of

56

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,030

companies have actually

tested this tactic.

57

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,510

But when comparing customers

who converted with the zero

58

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,125

based price versus those

with a nine base price,

59

00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,925

you'll notice that zeros have

roughly ten percent better net

60

00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:30,285

retention than those who

converted with a nine base price.

61

00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:31,645

Why is this happening?

62

00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:34,500

Well, keep in mind that individuals

converting from a nine base

63

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,900

price are feeling like

they're getting a discount,

64

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,620

and long time viewers of the

show know that discounted

65

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,425

customers tend not to be the

best customers for lifetime

66

00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:43,545

value and retention.

67

00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:46,025

When you're doing a nine based

price in a retail product,

68

00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:48,905

you don't necessarily care as

much about that repeat purchase

69

00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:51,930

because you're just trying to

spur that one time purchase.

70

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,790

It's not like they're buying

that coat as a subscription.

71

00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,570

So what should you do?

72

00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,865

Well, this is something you're gonna need

to test in your business individually.

73

00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:01,625

There isn't a very

clear heuristic,

74

00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,665

but keep in mind that if

your monetization strategy is

75

00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:08,505

terrible, this type of tactic is

not gonna save you at all.

76

00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:10,010

Well, that's all for now.

77

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,970
