In the last two decades our conception of A.I. has essentially been that of a Spielberg script or a Robin Williams performance - robots taking over the world. Yet, artificial intelligence and its baby cousin machine learning have actually had impressive advancements for everything from cybersecurity and healthcare to marketing and robotics.

Some of us use AI for evil though - not in creating bicentennial men and women, but as puffery in our marketing to confused consumers who just buy into the hype. So to answer Kevin’s question, we designed a pricing experiment with 10 and a half thousand software buyers.

#### A.I. Drives Willingness to Pay

We asked a control group their **[willingness to pay](https://www.paddle.com/resources/willingness-to-pay)** for a fake sales automation product. We then asked a demographically congruent group about the same sales product, but with a variation of “with “Artificial intelligence” in the marketing copy. We changed nothing, but the marketing copy.

We found that if you include A.I. in your copy, it will boost willingness to pay by essentially 10-15%. For better or for worse, when just mentioning machine learning, willingness to pay basically didn’t move.

What does this say about humanity? I don’t know if I’m qualified to answer that question, but this isn’t really anything new when it comes to marketing speak. There’s hype and over time consumers will get more educated and the impact of the marketing speak will diminish. So, for now if you’re using AI or machine learning, put it in your marketing copy, but make sure you have the product to back it up and you’re not just selling snake oil.

That's all for this week. Want to learn more?

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,895 --> 00:00:12,175

Hey, Patrick. It's Kevin

at Refract. I'm curious.

4

00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:15,710

How does AI and machine

learning affect the willingness

5

00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,270

to pay for a product

and the pricing?

6

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,470

In the last two decades,

7

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,110

our conception of

artificial intelligence has essentially

8

00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,615

been that of a Spielberg script

or a Robin Williams performance.

9

00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:27,455

Robots taking over the world.

10

00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:30,255

Yet artificial intelligence

and its baby cousin machine

11

00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:32,870

learning have actually had

impressive advancements for

12

00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,330

everything from cybersecurity and

health care to marketing and robotics.

13

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,865

Some of us use AI for evil

though, not in a bicentennial

14

00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:43,465

men and women sort of way,

15

00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:46,905

but as puffery in our marketing

to confuse consumers who just

16

00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:48,350

buy into the hype.

17

00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,790

So to answer Kevin's question,

18

00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,270

we designed a pricing

experiment with ten and a half

19

00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,870

thousand software buyers.

20

00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,910

We asked a control group their

willingness to pay for a fake

21

00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,275

sales automation product.

22

00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:01,395

We then asked a demographically

congruent group about the same

23

00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,275

sales product but with a

variation of quote with

24

00:01:04,275 --> 00:01:06,970

artificial intelligence

in the marketing copy.

25

00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,410

We changed nothing except

for the marketing copy.

26

00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,890

We found that if you

include AI in your copy,

27

00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,105

it will boost willingness to pay by

essentially ten to fifteen percent.

28

00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:19,665

For better or for worse,

when just mentioning machine

29

00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:23,280

learning, willingness to

pay basically didn't move.

30

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,840

So what does this

say about humanity?

31

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,960

I don't know if I'm exactly

the right person qualified to

32

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,865

answer that question marketing

33

00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:37,605

speak will diminish.

34

00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:40,800

So for now, if you're using AI,

marketing speak will diminish.

35

00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,680

So for now, if you're using

AI or machine learning,

36

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280

put it in your marketing copy,

37

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,005

but make sure you have the

product to back it up and

38

00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:49,765

you're not just

selling snake oil.

39

00:01:49,765 --> 00:01:50,965

Well, that's all for now.

40

00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:52,085

If you have a question,

41

00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:55,220

ship me an email or video to

p c at profit well dot com.

42

00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,900
