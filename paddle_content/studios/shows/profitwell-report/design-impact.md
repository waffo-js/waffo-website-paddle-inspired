# The Data From 70k Customers Reveals the Impact of Design

On this episode of the ProfitWell Report, we answer the simple yet widely debated question: How does design impact willingness to pay and growth?

 _**This episode might reference ProfitWell and ProfitWell Recur, which following the acquisition by Paddle is now[Paddle Studios](https://www.paddle.com/studios). Some information may be out of date.**_

_**Originally published: February 27, 2019**_

Design has become a qualitative non-negotiable. If you don’t have good design, prospects tend to distrust the value of your product and ultimately customers may be wooed away from a better designed product.

**At least** **that’s what you tend to hear devoid of any actual data** , so to answer this question we gathered data from over seventy thousand customers and nearly three thousand companies. Here’s what we found.

First up, to get a direct answer out of the way, **great design definitely boosts[willingness to pay](https://www.paddle.com/resources/willingness-to-pay).**

We coded respondents perception of a company’s web and product design before measuring their willingness to pay. **Those** **customers and prospects who perceived a company’s design positively had between an 18% and 41% higher willingness to pay than the median**. Those on the negative perception side had 4 to 11% lower willingness to pay.

[![Great Design Drives Higher Willingness to Pay](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659ca7c0531ac2845a273b56_GRAPH2-1.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

What’s fascinating about these results is that this indicates that **great design is a value added feature or aspect of the experience.** Bad design doesn’t necessarily take much away from the value perception of a product. In other words, design drives higher value, but doesn’t detract from value.

So should you not worry about your poorly designed experience?

Well, not exactly, because when we look at retention, what you’ll see is that those individuals with a positive perception of the company’s design**have roughly 8% to 12% better net retention than those who were neutral or had a negative perception.**

More research needs to be done here in particular, because like most things happening in the subscription market, the need for great and relevant design is becoming more and more important as a differentiator.

Yet, as the data suggests, **if you don’t have the rest of your house in order, great design probably isn’t going to save you.**

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,440

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:09,275

A quick question.

4

00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:13,195

How does design impact

willingness to pay and growth?

5

00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:15,970

Welcome back, everyone.

Neil here from ProfitWell.

6

00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,930

Design has become a

qualitative non negotiable.

7

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,370

If you don't have good design,

8

00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,735

prospects tend to distrust the value

of your product, and ultimately,

9

00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:26,375

customers may be wooed away

from a better designed product.

10

00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,135

At least that's what

you tend to hear,

11

00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:29,740

devoid of any actual data.

12

00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,940

So to answer this question,

13

00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,060

we looked at the data from over

seventy thousand customers and

14

00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,740

nearly three thousand companies.

15

00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,940

Here's what we found.

16

00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,805

First, to get the direct

answer out of the way,

17

00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:42,365

great design definitely

boosts willingness to pay.

18

00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:43,565

We coded respondents'

19

00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:46,685

perceptions of a company's

web and product design before

20

00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:48,150

measuring their

willingness to pay.

21

00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,430

The customers and prospects who

perceived a company's design

22

00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,550

positively had between an

eighteen and forty one percent

23

00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,345

higher willingness to

pay than the median.

24

00:00:56,345 --> 00:00:59,145

Those on the negative

perception had four to eleven

25

00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:00,905

percent lower

willingness to pay.

26

00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:03,785

Now what's fascinating about

these results is that this

27

00:01:03,785 --> 00:01:07,740

indicates that great design is

a value added feature or aspect

28

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,860

of the experience.

29

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,740

Bad design doesn't necessarily

take much away from the value

30

00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,945

perception of the product.

31

00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:15,425

In other words, design

drives higher value,

32

00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:17,425

but doesn't detract from value.

33

00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:20,545

So should you not worry about

your crappy design experience?

34

00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:22,180

Well, not exactly.

35

00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,780

Because when we

look at retention,

36

00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,180

what you'll see is that those

individuals with a positive

37

00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,755

perception of a company's

design has roughly eight to

38

00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,395

twelve percent better net

retention than those who are

39

00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:33,315

neutral or had a

negative perception.

40

00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:36,275

More research needs to be done

here in particular because like

41

00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:38,740

most things happening in

the subscription economy,

42

00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,620

the need for great and relevant

design is becoming more and

43

00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,460

more important as

a differentiator.

44

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,980

Yet, as the data suggests,

45

00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,625

if you don't have the rest

of your house in in order,

46

00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,185

great design probably

isn't gonna save you.

47

00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:51,465

Well, that's all for now.

48

00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:52,425
