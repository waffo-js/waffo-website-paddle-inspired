Increases in your average revenue per user can stem from many places. You can raise your price, get higher end customers, or coax more upgrades from your current customer base. Regardless of where expansion revenue comes from, it’s absolutely crucial to your success, especially in the world of subscriptions, because you want a healthy amount of expansion revenue to offset any churn that may creep into your business.

But first, if you like this kind of content and want to learn more, **[subscribe to get in the know](https://share.hsforms.com/17xcsifdtRi2xXbSPvncQow2fzi5)** when we release new episodes.

First up, we should understand what’s good expansion revenue from a benchmark perspective. The most efficient companies, when looking at lifetime value (LTV) to customer acquisition cost (CAC) ratios, are fueling that efficiency mainly off expansion revenue.

[![% of Total Sales that are Expansion Revenue](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cb2cd531ac2845a273b70_ScreenShot2019-06-25at10.57.47AM.webp?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Note that companies who have an LTV to CAC between three and five are seeing a median of just under 20% expansion revenue as a proportion of their total revenue. Those with an LTV to CAC above five are pushing above 30% in terms of expansion revenue.

Essentially, more expansion revenue is definitely better, but we want to get into a world where we’re seeing 20% or more of our revenue coming from expansion. A bedrock way to make this happen is to use what’s known as a value metric as the center of your pricing. A value metric is what you charge for – per user, per 100 visits, per thousand videos – it’s a measure for some proxy of value that you’re providing your customer.

**The beauty of a value metric is that customers are only paying for what they’re using, so churn tends to be lower with companies using this type of pricing model.** Expansion revenue tends to be much higher, as well.

[![Outcome Value Metrics Increase Expansion Revenue](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cb2da531ac2845a273b71_ScreenShot2019-06-25at10.57.55AM.webp?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Those companies using a value metric are seeing 30 to 100% higher levels of expansion revenue than their feature based pricing counterparts. Note that this gain occurs for both functional based value metrics, which would be a pricing model like per user, and for outcome based value metric, which would be like per conversion.

A bit more tactically, customer success also has a pretty significant impact on expansion revenue. **Those companies utilizing either scalable or dedicated customer success teams are seeing 60 to 120% higher levels of expansion revenue than those who have no customer success** indicating that the use of humans communicating value and spurring upgrades can actually greatly impact your bottom line.

[![Customer Success Boosts Expansion Revenue](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cb2e7531ac2845a273b72_ScreenShot2019-06-25at10.58.15AM.webp?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

While there are certainly very tactical offers and gimmicks you can use to increase your expansion revenue, the truth is that great expansion revenue requires you to put value at the core of your operations. Using a value metric in your pricing is a very specific decision that requires some careful thought. Making sure customer success exists in your business costs time and money. **Yet, if you remember that subscriptions are all about relationships, these decisions become easier, because you’ll want to continue to do things that get as close to customer value as possible.**

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:11,345

Hey, Neil. This is Ed

Lissinski, CEO of ZYT.

4

00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:11,985

I'd like to know,

5

00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:14,880

how do you increase

expansion revenue quickly?

6

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,580

Welcome back, everyone.

Neil here from ProfitWell.

7

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,520

Increase in your average revenue

per user can stem from many places.

8

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,565

You can raise your price,

get higher end customers,

9

00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:27,285

or coax more upgrades from

your current customer base.

10

00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:29,765

Regardless of where

expansion revenue comes from,

11

00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:33,370

it's absolutely crucial to

your success, especially

12

00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,095

Yet expansion revenue isn't

the easiest metric to increase.

13

00:00:42,095 --> 00:00:43,455

So to answer this question,

14

00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:45,695

we looked at just under

four thousand subscription

15

00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:47,855

companies, and

here's what we found.

16

00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:51,190

First up, we should understand

what's good expansion revenue from a

17

00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,850

benchmark perspective.

18

00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,710

The most efficient companies,

19

00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,030

when looking at

ltd to cap ratios,

20

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,675

are are fueling that efficiency

mainly off of expansion revenue.

21

00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:03,715

Note that companies who have

an LTV to CAC between three to

22

00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:06,515

five are seeing a median of

just under twenty percent

23

00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:09,950

expansion revenue as a proportion

of their total revenue.

24

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,710

Those with an LTV to CAC above

five are pushing above thirty

25

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,885

percent in terms of

expansion revenue.

26

00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:18,765

Essentially, more expansion

revenue is definitely better,

27

00:01:18,765 --> 00:01:21,245

but we wanna get into a world

where we're seeing twenty

28

00:01:21,245 --> 00:01:24,420

percent or more of our a

revenue coming from expansion.

29

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,380

A bedrock way to make this

happen is to use what's known

30

00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,615

as a value metric as a

center of your pricing.

31

00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:33,335

A value metric is what

you charge for per user,

32

00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:35,575

per hundred visits,

per thousand videos.

33

00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:38,455

It's a measure for some proxy

of value that you're providing

34

00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:40,035

to your customer.

35

00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,120

The beauty of a value metric is

that customers are only paying

36

00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,160

for what they're using,

37

00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,620

so churn tends to be lower with companies

using this type of pricing model.

38

00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,655

Expansion revenue tends

to be much higher as well.

39

00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:54,375

Those companies using a value

metric are seeing thirty to one

40

00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,370

hundred percent higher levels

of expansion revenue than their

41

00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,590

feature based

pricing counterparts.

42

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,650

Note that this gain occurs for

both functional based value

43

00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,055

metrics, which would be a

pricing model like per user,

44

00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:07,815

and for outcome

based value metric,

45

00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,875

which would be like

per conversion.

46

00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:13,302

A bit more tactically,

hundred and

47

00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:15,846

twenty percent

48

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:18,391

higher levels

49

00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:21,595

of success teams

are seeing sixty

50

00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:24,235

to a hundred and twenty percent

higher levels of expansion

51

00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:27,355

revenue than those who

have no customer success,

52

00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,370

indicating that the use of

humans communicating value and

53

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,290

spurring upgrades can actually

greatly impact your bottom line.

54

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,805

While there are certainly very

tactical offers and gimmicks

55

00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:39,285

you can use to increase

your expansion revenue,

56

00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:42,165

the truth is that great

expansion revenue requires you

57

00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:44,785

to put value at the

core of your operations.

58

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,560

Using a value metric in your

pricing is a very specific

59

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,440

decision that requires

some careful thought.

60

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,005

Making sure customer success exists

in your business costs time and money.

61

00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:58,445

Yet if you remember that subscriptions

are all about relationships,

62

00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,565

then these decisions become

easier because you'll want to

63

00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:03,630

continue to do things that get as close

to the customer value as possible.

64

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,697

Well, that's it for now.

65

00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:06,190
