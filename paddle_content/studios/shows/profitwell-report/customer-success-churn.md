# Customer Success Reduces Churn & Increases Expansion Revenue

On this episode of the ProfitWell Report, we looked at the data from just under 2 thousand companies within the subscription space to break down break down whether customer success reduces churn & increases expansion revenue. Here’s what we found.

Customer success has been one of those parts of the organization that we all know we need, but it's been tough to define exactly what customer success entails. Is it a part of the product organization combating churn and NPS through scalable initiatives or is it part of the revenue organization focusing on upsells, renewals, and expansion?

[![Customer Success Impacts Net Retention](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659ca65d531ac2845a273b4f_ScreenShot2018-10-03at11.44.40AM-2-.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Customer success has **[an aggregate impact on net retention](https://churnzero.net/understanding-the-real-impact-of-improving-customer-retention/)** with those companies with some sort of customer success function seeing at least a 10% boost in**[net dollar retention](https://www.paddle.com/blog/net-dollar-retention)** compared to their non-customer success peers. Note though that dedicated customer success, meaning a full customer success organization that’s staffed in an account management fashion sees an additional 5% bump.

Digging deeper this analysis only shows a blunt interpretation of customer successes impact, because the data suggests that customer success actually doesn’t impact gross churn as much as it impacts expansion revenue.

[![Customer Success Only Loosely Contributes to Churn Reduction](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659ca66b531ac2845a273b50_Graph2-033.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Take a look here at our same groups broken down by aggregate gross churn. There’s definitely a drop in churn for those organizations with customer success showing a 15 to 27% drop in gross churn.

[![Customer Success Boosts Expansion Revenue](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659ca677531ac2845a273b52_Graph1-033.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Yet, when we look at the same organizations from an expansion revenue perspective, we find that we’re seeing roughly a 50 to 125% increase in expansion revenue compared to those organizations without customer success.

So what does this mean then?

Well, customer success is absolutely valuable, but the implication is that their value is in an expansion revenue capacity, encouraging customers to find more and more value in our products and therefore spend more with us over time.

A deeper implication here is that gross churn can absolutely be influenced by customer success - I’ll take a 15 to 30% drop any day - yet, gross churn is likely more greatly influenced by your targeting of the right customer and product, the elusive persona/product fit.

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:11,495

Hey, Patrick. Emery

from Frame. Io here.

4

00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:14,215

And my question for the week

is how does customer success

5

00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,590

impact retention and churn?

6

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,910

Customer success has been

one of those parts of the

7

00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,710

organization that we all know

that we intrinsically need,

8

00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,305

but it's been

tough to define you

9

00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,540

you're focused on

upsells and expansion?

10

00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,700

The truth is probably

somewhere in between,

11

00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,580

but the more interesting

question is, is it working?

12

00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,260

So to answer Emery's

question here,

13

00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,745

we looked at just under five thousand

companies and the data therein.

14

00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,105

Here's what we found.

15

00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:47,225

As to not bury the lead,

16

00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:50,550

customer success has an aggregate

impact on net retention,

17

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,790

with those companies with

some sort of customer success

18

00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,990

function seeing at least a ten

percent boost in net dollar

19

00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,375

retention compared to those

without customer success.

20

00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,775

Note though that dedicated

customer success teams,

21

00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:05,215

meaning those who have account

managers per customer in some

22

00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:08,820

ratio like banner, are seeing

an additional five percent bump.

23

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,500

Digging deeper, this analysis only

shows a blunt interpretation of

24

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,380

customer success's impact

because the data suggests that

25

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,735

customer success actually

doesn't impact gross churn as

26

00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:20,895

much as it impacts

expansion revenue.

27

00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:23,215

There's definitely a drop in

churn for those organizations

28

00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:26,370

with customer success showing a

fifteen to twenty seven percent

29

00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,890

drop in gross churn.

30

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,090

Yet when we look at the same

organizations from an expansion

31

00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,370

revenue perspective,

32

00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,725

we find that we're seeing

roughly a fifty to a hundred

33

00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:37,765

and twenty five percent

increase in expansion revenue

34

00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,885

compared to those organizations

without customer success.

35

00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:42,140

So what does this

all mean? Mean?

36

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,780

Well, customer success

is absolutely valuable,

37

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,580

but the implication here is

that the value is more in an

38

00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,340

expansion revenue capacity,

39

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,935

encouraging customers to find

more and more value in your

40

00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:54,895

product and therefore spend

more with you over time.

41

00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:59,150

A deeper implication here is that gross

churn can absolutely be influenced

42

00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,025

Well, that's all for now.

43

00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:09,985
