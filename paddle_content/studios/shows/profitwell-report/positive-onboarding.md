# Solid Customer Onboarding Drives Higher Retention, Willingness to Pay

On this episode of the ProfitWell Report, we're breaking down how a company's onboarding impacts customer willingness to pay and retention.

 _**This episode might reference ProfitWell and ProfitWell Recur, which following the acquisition by Paddle is now[Paddle Studios](https://www.paddle.com/studios). Some information may be out of date.**_

_**Originally published: February 20, 2019**_

To answer J-Kim’s question, we looked at just under 500 different software products spread between B2B and B2C and nearly twenty five thousand customers of those products. Here’s what we found.

**This was actually the trickiest question to date** , because coding onboarding perception and then measuring willingness to pay is a non-trivial task. 

We coded respondents perception of a company’s onboarding before measuring their willingness to pay.

#### 

Those customers who perceived a **[company’s onboarding](https://www.paddle.com/resources/customer-onboarding)** positively had between a 12% and 21% higher willingness to pay than the median. Those on the negative side had a 3% to 9% drop in willingness to pay, indicating that **poor onboarding doesn’t necessarily detract too much, but can certainly miss out on some large willingness to pay gains.**

[![Great Onboarding Drives Higher Willingness to Pay](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cb5f3531ac2845a273b7a_GRAPH1.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Digging further, we compared those companies with purely functional onboarding to companies making a greater effort, doing things like introducing the team, pointing out how the product’s going to help the customer, etc.

Those with purely functional, but well perceived onboarding, did boost willingness to pay for the product between 8 and 17 percent, but **those who additionally** **focused on value squeezed roughly another 10% in terms of willingness to pay.**

[![Value Based Onboarding Drives Willingness to Pay](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cb604531ac2845a273b7b_GRAPH2.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

Retention is where things get really interesting. When comparing the first 60 days of customers with poor perceptions of onboarding to those with positive perceptions, those **customers with positive perception have much less drop off in the first 21 days of being a customer.**

[![Great Onboarding Boosts Overall Retention](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/659cb611531ac2845a273b7c_GRAPH3.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_medium=website&utm_source=paddle-studios&utm_campaign=paddle-studios_fy2024)

One point to keep in mind is that we found extremely high fragmentation amongst customers in their perceptions of company’s onboarding. Put simply, most customers didn’t agree that a product had good or bad onboarding, which indicates this is still a new area we’re trying to master as a community within our products.

That being said, data indicates that **great onboarding is essential to engraining the value of a product within a customer** or at the very least greases the skids of your customer to start to see the value in your product, accelerating their journey significantly.

1

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,440

You've got the questions,

and we have the data.

2

00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,620

This is the ProfitWell Report.

3

00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:10,675

It's Jonathan from Appcues.

4

00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:13,015

Obviously, we think a lot

about onboarding here.

5

00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:16,590

And one thing that I'd love

to know is how you see onboarding

6

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,870

typically affect willingness to

pay as well as the customer's

7

00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,530

retention over time.

8

00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,475

What's up, everyone? Neil here.

9

00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:25,235

Welcome back to the

profitable report.

10

00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:28,275

This was actually a really

tricky question because coding

11

00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:31,470

onboarding perception and then

measuring willingness to pay is

12

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,990

a non trivial task.

13

00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,470

We got it done though because

we promised Jonathan we would,

14

00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,910

so give us some extra credit.

15

00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,575

To answer Jake Kim's question,

16

00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:41,055

we looked at just under five

hundred different software

17

00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:44,575

products spread between b to

b and b to c and nearly twenty

18

00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:46,950

five thousand customers

of those products.

19

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,310

Here's what we found.

20

00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,710

We coded respondents

perceptions of a company's

21

00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,510

onboarding before measuring

their willingness to pay.

22

00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,295

Those customers who perceived

a company's onboarding positively

23

00:00:57,295 --> 00:01:00,175

had between a twelve percent

and a twenty one percent higher

24

00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:01,855

willingness to pay

than the median.

25

00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:04,895

Those on the negative side had

a three to nine percent drop in

26

00:01:04,895 --> 00:01:05,920

willingness to pay,

27

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,200

indicating that poor onboarding

doesn't necessarily detract too much,

28

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,935

but can certainly miss out on some

large willingness to pay gains.

29

00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:16,215

Digging further, we compared those

companies with purely functional

30

00:01:16,215 --> 00:01:19,950

onboarding, things like pointing

out the features, how tos,

31

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,150

along with those who mix the

functional with brand and value

32

00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,110

proposition onboarding, things

like introducing the team,

33

00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,450

pointing out how the product's

gonna help the customers, etcetera.

34

00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:31,185

Those with purely functional,

35

00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:34,145

but well perceived onboarding

did boost willingness to pay

36

00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:36,865

for the product between

eight and seventeen percent.

37

00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:39,730

But those who additionally

focused on value squeeze

38

00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,690

roughly another ten percent in

terms of willingness to pay.

39

00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,730

Now retention is where things

really get interesting.

40

00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,005

When comparing the first sixty

days of the customers with poor

41

00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:52,045

perception of onboarding to

those with positive perceptions,

42

00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,405

those customers with positive

perception have much less drop

43

00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:58,250

off in the first twenty one

days of being a customer.

44

00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,650

One point to keep in mind

though is that we found

45

00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,370

extremely high fragmentation

amongst customers in their

46

00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,345

perceptions of

company onboarding.

47

00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:10,065

Put simply, most customers didn't agree

that a product had good or bad onboarding,

48

00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:12,705

which indicates that this is

still a new area we're trying

49

00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:15,490

to master as a community

within our products.

50

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,970

That being said, data indicates that

great onboarding is essential to

51

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,250

engraving the value of a

product within a customer or at

52

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,275

the very least greases the

skids of your customer to start

53

00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:28,115

to see the value

in your product,

54

00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,435

significantly accelerating

their journey.

55

00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:31,950

Well, that's all for now.

56

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,910
