## An Introduction to Brian Halligan

Starting a business is no longer difficult, but scaling a business has become intensely tough. You not only need to be insanely great at basically everything, but you can't make many mistakes - or at least any of them twice. 

On this episode of Protect the Hustle, we talk to [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/?__hstc=174954301.1c0c019867117b3c5504d6b0c0e51260.1601988443796.1601999939928.1602003554915.5&__hssc=174954301.3.1602003554915&__hsfp=3049890301)'s CEO and Co-Founder Brian Halligan about the process of scaling up, staying motivated with lofty goals, and tackling big meaty problems. Brian's used these skills to scale HubSpot to the #1 spot in the marketing automation market with a $4.7B market cap and is now taking on the sales and help desk markets. He also shares the story of getting "Wolf", the guitar made famous by Jerry Garcia of The Grateful Dead.
