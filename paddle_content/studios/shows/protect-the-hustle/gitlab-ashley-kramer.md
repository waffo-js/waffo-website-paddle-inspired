# GitLab's Ashley Kramer on Navigating the Open-Source Cosmos

This week's guest is Ashley Kramer, CMO and CSO of GitLab, who enlightens us about the power and principles of the open-source model, and how it forms the backbone of success in the expansive cosmos of the B2B SaaS world.

## An Introduction to Ashley Kramer

 _**“As an executive I have to tell myself to stop and explain the why. But when you have very clear OKRs, it's very easy for me to step back and say, ‘Okay, we're going to align those because of this and this is going to be our focus.’”**_

\- Ashley Kramer

Imagine a meticulously planned space mission, where precision, openness, and shared understanding permeate every stage, from engineers poring over blueprints to astronauts preparing for liftoff and ground control teams monitoring every telemetry detail. Transparency, serving as a beacon amidst the dark expanse, ensures each decision is rooted in a shared mission objective, fostering an environment where mistakes are minimized, and success is within grasp. This celestial journey parallels the world of B2B SaaS, a digital cosmos where similar principles of precision, openness, and shared understanding drive success. The open-source model emerges as the guiding star, illuminating the path towards collaborative product development, informed by clear insights into user needs and market dynamics.

Guiding us on this digital odyssey is [Ashley Kramer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleyekramer/), CMO and CSO of [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), who embodies the principles of openness and transparency, quintessential for success in the SaaS world. Her experience in adopting these principles at GitLab, coupled with her literal journey as a former NASA employee, make her an invaluable guide for navigating the open-source universe. In today's episode, we dive into Ashley's insights into the open-source model, unearthing the transformative power of transparency and the pivotal role of consistent release schedules. Tune in as we explore how Ashley applies these principles at GitLab and how they can fuel your SaaS journey. It's time to strap in for an enlightening voyage through the SaaS cosmos.

#### High Level Overview:

  * Transparency and clear communication are fundamental in a company, particularly in a SaaS or technology organization. Implementing a "safe framework" to manage the dissemination of sensitive information can alleviate fears about over-sharing and nurture trust within teams.
  * Leveraging personal experiences can significantly enrich product development and marketing strategies. Direct exposure to user's pain points and needs results in a more empathetic and targeted approach.
  * Implementing a regular release schedule, like GitLab's policy of releasing every 22nd of the month, instills discipline, creates a predictable environment, and enhances team alignment towards goals.
  * Flexibility in roles, as demonstrated by Ashley juggling CMO, CSO, and Acting CTO roles, can offer a broader perspective of the company's functions and foster better collaboration across different units.
  * Building a product that you yourself would use, as Ashley did when she chose GitLab as a platform while at Alteryx, leads to a more user-centric product, ultimately boosting its usability and appeal to customers.


#### Ashley Kramer's Guide to Open-Source:

Open-source is the cornerstone of the tech industry today. It endorses a culture of collaboration and transparency, fuelling shared growth, and promoting innovation. The open code permits constant evolution, security enhancements, and adaptations to meet diverse needs.

##### Foster Transparency

  * Encourage openness not just in the product code but also in the company culture. This openness should extend to company policies, decision-making processes, and communication, creating a sense of inclusion and trust among team members.


##### Clear Communication Guidelines

  * Establish a "safe framework" that outlines what information can be divulged and what should be kept confidential. This clarity eliminates confusion and reduces the risk of improper disclosure of sensitive data.


##### Harness the Power of Customer Feedback

  * Customer feedback can provide invaluable insights into the product's strengths and weaknesses. This feedback should be regularly analyzed and integrated into the product development process to continuously enhance the product's value and align it more closely with user needs.


##### Regular Release Schedules

  * Consistent, regular release schedules contribute to operational efficiency. This practice instills discipline in the team, ensures that developments are timely, and provides a sense of predictability for both the team and the customers.


##### "Dogfooding"

  * Use your own product, a practice often referred to as "dogfooding". This enables the team to gain firsthand knowledge of the product's usability and performance, identify potential issues early on, and develop a deeper empathy with end-users.


When embarking on an open-source strategy, remember that it involves more than just keeping the code open. It's a cultural shift towards openness, collaboration, and ongoing learning. It involves building a community that's united by a shared vision and is actively contributing towards the product's growth and success.
