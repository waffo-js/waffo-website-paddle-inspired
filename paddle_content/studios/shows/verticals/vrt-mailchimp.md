# How Mailchimp fights spam

On this episode of Verticals, we explore Mailchimp's bootstrapped beginnings, its impressive growth, and secret for avoiding the spam filter.

Spam. We all hate getting it and no one wants to end up sending it.

When was the last time you checked your spam folder? You’ve got anti-virus solutions, political ads, the classic “enhancement” emails… and as a user you probably don’t look at it much. And you’d never intentionally SEND spam, right?

Email is the backbone of any successful SaaS marketing campaign. More than half of the [global population uses it.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/255080/number-of-e-mail-users-worldwide/) From creating powerful newsletters to offering customer support, the use cases of email in SaaS is ubiquitous. But the threat of spam lurks beyond the click of every send button. It’s a punishment so dastardly that it can torpedo the hopes and dreams of the sender.

Spam messages account for [roughly half of all email traffic](https://www.statista.com/statistics/420391/spam-email-traffic-share/). And roughly [one out of every 10](https://www.statista.com/statistics/690939/spam-placement-rate/). So while you may not intentionally send spam, if you’re not careful, a series of bad campaigns can snowball into you being blacklisted from customers.

So, how do you fight Spam? There are dubious methods, but this won’t build trust with your audience. Instead, we need to look to experts in the space like Mailchimp. While today Mailchimp boasts over [13 million users](https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/mailchimp-statistics/), the bootstrapped company was not an overnight success story. They had no outside funding to rely on, so success was predicated on keeping deliverability rates high while striving to be a notable SaaS brand that folks could learn from. All of this culminated in a $12-billion purchase by Intuit, thrusting Mailchimp into the bootstrapped hall of fame…

### Lessons from the Top

[Mailchimp CEO Ben Chestnut](https://youtu.be/ialssZI_Dv0?t=126) has the answer to beating Spam after decades and a metric ton of emails sent. I’ll tell you what that is, but first we’ve got to get into some background on Mailchimp and the email marketing space.

Today, email marketing is essential to any marketing strategy. It’s an effective way to grow your brand as well as connect with, engage with, and nurture your customers. But, you have to get it right. And unfortunately most companies don’t.

Mailchimp, however, has not only managed to get it right, it’s also managed to stay out of spam folders. And its strategy is pretty simple — always provide really good content.

  * **Be useful**  
Avoid the fluff completely. Be authentic and focus on value. In a time when we’re inundated with content, providing valuable and relevant content is do or die. Take the time to provide the quality and value your customers deserve and want. After all, your content is representative of your business. The more value you provide, the more customers you acquire, and more importantly, the more you keep.
  * **Think outside the traditional marketing box**  
Mailchimp has embraced being different and, ultimately, it’s what has made them stand out. They’re not afraid to go against the grain and be bold when it comes to its marketing campaigns. Don’t follow what everyone else is doing, instead embrace what makes your business unique and use it. Try new things. Take chances.  

  * **Be accessible to more**  
Mailchimp's willingness to take chances also crosses over into switching things up when something’s not providing optimal results. In its efforts to stay true to its original goal of helping small businesses establish themselves through inexpensive email marketing, it decided to go freemium — even after years of charging for its service.   
Mailchimp's commitment to providing value was and is the perfect complement to freemium. And by making its service free it was able to reach a wider audience, a move that has proven to be extremely fruitful.


### **Background**

In 1978, [a marketing manager named Gary Thuerk](https://web.archive.org/web/20080628205216/http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-fi-spam11may11001420,1,5168218,full.story) (Turk) composed an email that he sent out via ARPANET (the predecessor of the Internet). Within this email, Thuerk advertised open houses in Los Angeles and San Mateo where his employer, Digital Equipment Corp, would unveil their latest computers. ARPAnet had several thousand users, but Thuerk targeted the 600 users on the West Coast. Instead of sending individual emails to each user, Thuerk asked [his assistant](https://www.edn.com/1st-spam-email-is-sent-may-3-1978/) to send one mass email to all the users. He didn’t know it at the time, but Gary Thuerk had just sent what historians claim was the first Spam email. And it worked. As ingenious and uncharacteristic as this marketing tactic may sound, it fetched Thuerk and his company 20 sales over the next three years of open houses at $1 million each. However, the tactic wasn't without its fair share of controversies. In the days that followed, ARPAnet representatives approached Thuerk, warned him, and made him swear never to do it again.

![VRT-S01-E03-Email_Marketing-2-Background1](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/M2U3MThjZmQtZWMxMy00ZmUzLWE2YTUtOTg0MmYxNTA0NjI2_vrt-s01-e03-email_marketing-2-background1.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=3840)

As you'd expect, and in light of Thuerk's marketing success, no one listened to this advice. More and more marketers tried their luck with email tactics in the years that followed. And with webmail providers like Hotmail and Yahoo, it became easier and easier to send email. While some used email for nefarious reasons, there were genuine marketers trying to sell legit products. Unfortunately, even senders with the best intentions ended up going to spam.

It wasn’t until the turn of the millennium that spamming was declared a real menace. Spam filters hadn’t been invented and slow broadband speeds meant loading messages took up precious time. The first real combat against spam in the US was mounted in 2003, and it came in the form of the [CAN-SPAM Act](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business). An acronym for "Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing." The actual meaning of this regulation is weaved right into the words. At its core, the CAN-SPAM Act sets tight regulations for commercial email messages, as well as gives recipients the right to unsubscribe from a mailing list, if and when they want to. An email marketer that violates this law can be subject to some incredibly steep penalties, ranging from fines of [$16,000 per spam email ](https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/can-spam/)to criminal penalties of up to five years in prison. Therefore, it’s absolutely crucial that SaaS marketers have the right tools to avoid these punishments. So how does one get past the spam filter? Well, it’s not time to hear from Ben Chestnut just yet… but the answer begins with the development of email marketing tools.

### **Early Leaders**

Tools for email marketers were primitive in the early 2000s. There was still a gaping hole that needed to be filled — that of designing emails, segmenting recipient lists, marketing automation, and the like. Consequently, several companies rose to fill that gap, with the sole aim of providing impeccable email marketing solutions that would put marketers right into their customers' and prospects' inboxes, and especially, avoid the spam folder. The early lineup itself was star-studded, consisting of companies like Constant Contact, Litmus, and Campaign Monitor. But as they say, the pacesetters aren't always the game-changers. It's those who work the smartest — not the hardest — that take that crown. Enter Mailchimp.

![VRT-S01-E03-Email_Marketing-3-Early_Leaders2](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/ZDM5OTdjMjktNzA4Ny00OTU1LThkYjUtODE1MjI2OTBkODcz_vrt-s01-e03-email_marketing-3-early_leaders2.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=3840)

The [story of Mailchimp ](https://mailchimp.com/about/#:~:text=Founder%20story&amp;text=Mailchimp%20was%20designed%20as%20an,them%20and%20helped%20them%20grow.)isn't your ordinary get-popular-quickly story. It's a story of patience and lots of it. The premier email marketing service was first launched in 2001 by two ardent web designers, Dan Kurzius and Ben Chestnut. At the time of launching Mailchimp, the two had one goal and one goal only: to help small businesses, like theirs, establish themselves through distinguishable, inexpensive email marketing. They were never in it for the money. As such, they treated the service as a side endeavor. It wasn’t until 2007 that Kurzius and Chestnut decided to put all their eggs in the Mailchimp basket. Email marketing, however, wasn't exactly the best investment in 2007. For starters, spamming was at its all-time high (research has it that spam accounted for [95% of all email traffic](https://www.cnet.com/culture/study-95-percent-of-all-e-mail-sent-in-2007-was-spam/) that year alone). And people detested the very thought of a commercial email landing in their inboxes. But perhaps even more demotivating for the two co-founders was the fact that better-funded companies were already ruling the email marketing space. But Kurzius and Chestnut didn't give up. If anything, they ramped up their efforts.

![VRT-S01-E03-Email_Marketing-3-Early_Leaders3a](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/MDllOGY1NzMtYTEwOC00ZDc4LWFhNzMtZmI4NjBkN2UwNmFk_vrt-s01-e03-email_marketing-3-early_leaders3a.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=3840)

For the better part of its history, Mailchimp has been a bootstrapped company. The company pretty much survived as a self-funded, self-sufficient entity. Mailchimp managed to grow beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Using the platform, customers are now able to create and manage an audience, configure their email marketing campaigns, and monitor their performance — all on one platform. Mailchimp's growth has been gradual and sometimes brutal, but it has certainly been worth it. In 2021, Mailchimp had a revenue run rate of [a whopping $800 million](https://whatisthebusinessmodelof.com/business-models/mailchimp-business-model/), and was purchased by Intuit for [$12 billion.](https://mailchimp.com/intuit-completes-mailchimp-acquisition/)

### **Reasons for success**

What makes Mailchimp one of the best — if not the best — email marketing companies today is the fact that their value is directly tied to the success of their customers. As CEO, [Ben Chestnut said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ialssZI_Dv0&amp;t=206s), “We grow when your customers grow. It’s free to use MailChimp until their databases get to 2,000 members and then we start charging.” But MailChimp didn’t start out with a freemium offering. For eight years, they charged for the product without a freemium tier. [The decision to offer freemium](https://technologyadvice.com/blog/marketing/how-mailchimp-grew-to-12-million-users/#:~:text=They%20knew%20that%20some%20of%20their%20customers%20would%20switch%20to%20the%20free%20plan.%20They%20were%20ready%20to%20take%20that%20hit%20so%20they%20could%20offer%20their%20tools%20and%20expertise%20to%20a%20wider%20audience%20%E2%80%94%20one%20that%20would%20otherwise%20pass%20them%20by.) was predicated on the idea that some customers would switch to freemium from paid. However, this was a risk Ben Chestnut and co were willing to take as they would now be able to offer their tools and expertise to a wider audience. The fact that Mailchimp is still around today is proof that a freemium offering (even late in the game) is by no means a death sentence — quite the contrary.

In a world where most email marketing solutions stick with the same branding for years, Mailchimp also stands out for being bold, quirky, and fun with its branding. Over the years, they have had several successful marketing campaigns. But, about five years ago they had a stroke of marketing genius. At the time, many people were curious about Mailchimp and what it actually brought to the table. In response, the company created a one-of-a-kind brand awareness campaign to fill that all-too-obvious curiosity gap. It was dubbed "[Did You Mean MailChimp?](https://www.thedrum.com/creative-works/project/droga5-mailchimp-did-you-mean-mailchimp#:~:text=Despite%20having%20a%20name%20that's,brand%20as%20%22MailKimp%22\).)" To get the campaign up and running, Mailchimp crafted many different sites along with rich, well thought-out promotional social media videos. All these campaigns had one thing in common: their names closely resembled Mailchimp. From KaleLimp to FailChips and JailBlimp, whenever someone looked up these quirky terms, they would bump right into Mailchimp. Occupying many different advertising and social channels meant that Mailchimp was everywhere creative-minded businesses might be, without having to use its real name. That's a marketing masterstroke and it's a hallmark of a truly distinguishable SaaS business.

But how do you run a creative company? What’s the secret ingredient to success? As Ben Chestnut says, “it’s about the people.” Since its origins, Mailchimp has succeeded by empowering employees to be themselves, even with quirky promotional campaigns like "cat hats", or "hats for cats." They’ve established a particular brand by being different. By going against the grain of the usual humdrum SaaS playbook, Mailchimp has invented their own style guide.

![VRT-S01-E03-Email_Marketing-4-Success2](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/MDcyODQ1NzMtNGViNy00MTJiLTk3YjItY2MxYjU1N2RiOTFm_vrt-s01-e03-email_marketing-4-success2.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=3840)

Additionally, and the reason you’re all here, Mailchimp knows the answer to defeat spam. Going back to that CNBC interview in 2017, Ben Chestnut’s answer is simple: “Be useful and people will like your content and not block you.” Easier said than done of course, but Mailchimp understands this and they understand that if their users don’t then growth will be stagnant. Through their blog and helpdocs, you can understand strategies and tactics on how to be useful. But perhaps the best tool Mailchimp offers is leading by example with their brand.

### **Summary**

For producing, sending, and managing outstanding newsletters and email marketing campaigns, you need a tool that's customer-facing at its core and one whose features are always improving. Mailchimp is one tool that truly helps SaaS marketers get the job done — faster, better, and with only a pinch of their resources.

But there's a caveat to all this. Even with an effective tool like Mailchimp, your campaigns will still hit a snag if you fail to create relevant, quirky, interesting newsletters. The modern email recipients are savvy and well-exposed, and the only way to lure them in is to be truly authentic and value-focused. Anything less will inevitably see the inside of a spam folder.

At present, the email marketing spectrum is looking promising and Mailchimp is one of many selections. Over the years, Mailchimp has expanded beyond just email marketing services. The company now provides website hosting services, data analysis tools, social media management technology, and a dozen other products; it's essentially a full-fledged marketing platform. Beyond that, innovative works of integrating email marketing with cloud-based and AI technologies suggest that the industry will only get better, more profitable, and certainly more accommodating from here on out.

However, only the SaaS marketers that are willing to break out of their comfort zones and adopt game-changing technologies, like Mailchimp, will ultimately reap the biggest rewards. Mailchimp’s exact success circumstances probably can’t be replicated, but whether you choose them for their services, or as an example to follow, you’re in good hands. Do you use Mailchimp or a different email marketing provider? Let me know.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,961

\- Junkmail, Mailchimp, and

Intuit coming together.

2

00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:05,505

\- Thank you very much.

3

00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,339

\- Spam.

4

00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,173

We all hate it.

5

00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,426

And none of us want to end up sending it.

6

00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,220

I'm sure that you've

got antivirus solutions,

7

00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,765

political ads, the classic

enhancement emails.

8

00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:16,599

As a user,

9

00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,976

you probably don't look at that much

10

00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,646

and you'd never intentionally

send spam, right?

11

00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:25,150

Spam messages account for

roughly half of all email traffic

12

00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,028

and roughly one out of every

10 commercial emails sent

13

00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,988

is considered spam..

14

00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,406

So how do you fight spam?

15

00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,366

There are dubious methods, I'm sure,

16

00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,702

but this won't build

trust with your audience.

17

00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,163

Instead, we need to look

to experts in the space.

18

00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:38,997

\- Mailchimp.

19

00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:39,831

\- Mailchimp.

20

00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,665

\- Mailchimp.

\- Mailchimp.

22

00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,626

\- While today Mailchimp

boasts over 13 million users.

23

00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,838

The bootstrapped company was

not an overnight success story.

24

00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,090

With no outside funding to rely on,

25

00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,552

success was predicated on

keeping deliverability rates high

26

00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,846

while striving to be a notable SAS brand

27

00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,139

that folks can learn from.

28

00:00:56,139 --> 00:01:00,185

Mailchimp CEO Ben Chestnut has

the answer to beating spam.

29

00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,312

\- How do you get past spam, a spam filter?

30

00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,731

\- I'll tell you what that is.

31

00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,484

And I'm keen to hear your

guesses in the comments below

32

00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,611

but first we've gotta

get into some background

33

00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,489

on Mailchimp and the

email marketing space.

34

00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,448

I'm Ben Hillman.

35

00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,616

And this is Verticals.

36

00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,498

In 1978, a marketing

manager named Gary Thuerk

37

00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,167

imposed an email that

he sent out via ARPANET,

38

00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,336

the predecessor of the internet.

39

00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,671

Within this email Thuerk

advised open houses

40

00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,715

in Los Angeles and San Mateo

41

00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,009

where his employer, Digital Equipment Corp

42

00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,053

would unveil their latest computers.

43

00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,430

ARPANET had several thousand users

44

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,059

but Thuerk targeted the 600

users on the west coast.

45

00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,894

Instead of sending individual emails

46

00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,771

to each individual user,

47

00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,939

Thuerk asked his assistant

48

00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,608

to send one mass email

to all the business.

49

00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,235

He didn't know it at the time

50

00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,655

but Gary Thuerk had just

sent what historians claimed

51

00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,365

as the first spam email.

52

00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,826

It fetch Thuerk and his company 20 sales

53

00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:02,080

over the next three years of

open houses at $1 million each.

54

00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,333

This tactic wasn't without its

fair share of controversies.

55

00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,460

In the days that followed

ARPANET representatives

56

00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,962

approached Thuerk and warned him

57

00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,631

and made him swear to never do it again.

58

00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,508

No one listened to this advice,

59

00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,218

more and more marketers tried their luck

60

00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,220

with email tactics in

the years that followed

61

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,556

while some used email

foreign nefarious reasons

62

00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,807

there were genuine marketers,

63

00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,976

like Gary trying to sell legit products.

64

00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,935

It wasn't until the turn

65

00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,063

of the millennium that spamming

was declared a real menace.

66

00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,191

Spam filters hadn't been invented

and slow broadband speeds

67

00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,194

meant loading messages took

precious, precious time.

68

00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,698

The first real combat against spam

69

00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,616

in the US was mounted in 2003.

70

00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,536

And it came in the form

of the CAN-SPAM act,

71

00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,663

an acronym for Controlling the Assault

72

00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,416

of Non-Solicited

Pornography and Marketing.

73

00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,544

The actual meaning of which

is weaved read into the words.

74

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,131

At its core, the CAN-SPAM

act sets tight regulations

75

00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,549

for commercial email messages,

76

00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,177

as well as gives recipients

the right to unsubscribe

77

00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,386

from a mailing list.

78

00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,929

If and when they want to.

79

00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,557

An email marketer that violates

this law can be subject

80

00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,351

to some incredibly steep penalties,

81

00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,272

ranging from fines of

$16,000 per spam email

82

00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,442

to criminal penalties of

up to five years in prison.

83

00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,652

So how does one get past the spam filter?

84

00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,072

Well, it's not time to hear

from Ben Chestnut just yet.

85

00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,574

But the answer begins

86

00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,035

with the development of

email marketing tools.

87

00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,246

Tools for email marketers were primitive

88

00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,706

in the early 2000s.

89

00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,334

There was still a gaping

hole that needed to be filled

90

00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,629

that of designing emails,

segmenting recipient lists,

91

00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,923

marketing automation, and alike.

92

00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,218

Consequently, several companies

rose to fill that gap.

93

00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,844

The early lineup consisted of companies

94

00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:43,014

like Constant Contact,

Litmus and Campaign Monitor.

95

00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,015

With the sole aim

96

00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,935

of providing impeccable

email marketing solutions

97

00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,311

that would put marketers right

98

00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,855

into their customers and prospects inboxes

99

00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:55,276

and especially avoid the

spam filter, enter Mailchimp.

100

00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,861

As I've mentioned, the story of Mailchimp

101

00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,072

isn't a get popular quickly story.

102

00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,450

It's a story of patience and lots of it.

103

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,494

The premier email marketing

service was first launched

104

00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,579

in 2001 by two art and web designers,

105

00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,498

Dan Kurzius and Ben Chestnut.

106

00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,124

At the time of launching Mailchimp,

107

00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,918

two had only one goal.

108

00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,836

\- Okay, we helped small

businesses build their brand

109

00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,046

and sell their stuff.

110

00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,631

\- They weren't really in it for the money

111

00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,842

and as such they treated the

service as a side endeavor.

112

00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,971

It wasn't until 2007 that

Kurzius and Chestnut decided

113

00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,015

to put all of their eggs

in the Mailchimp basket.

114

00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,767

Email marketing, however,

115

00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,937

wasn't exactly the best

investment in 2007.

116

00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,940

For starters, spamming

was at an all time high,

117

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,525

research has it that spam accounted

118

00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,861

for 95% of all email

traffic that year alone

119

00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,155

but perhaps even more demotivating

120

00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,116

for the two co-founders was the fact

121

00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,534

that better funded companies

122

00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,328

were already ruling the

email marketing space,

123

00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,039

Kurzius and Chestnut didn't give up,

124

00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,040

Mailchimp managed to grow

125

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,668

beyond anyone's wildest imaginations.

126

00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,546

In 2021, Mailchimp had a revenue run rate

127

00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,048

of a whopping $800 million

128

00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,260

and was purchased by Intuit

for 12 billion dollars.

129

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,054

\- Be more excited about

what's possible ahead

130

00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:05,888

for both of us.

131

00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,766

\- What makes Mailchimp one of the best,

132

00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,102

if not the best email

marketing companies today

133

00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,312

is the fact that their value

134

00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,481

is directly tied to the

success of their customers.

135

00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,899

As CEO, Ben Chestnut said.

136

00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,152

\- We grow and our customers grow.

137

00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,236

So it's free to use Mailchimp,

138

00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,739

until their databases get to 2000 members.

139

00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,450

\- But Mailchimp didn't start

out with a freemium offering,

140

00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,785

for eight years, they

charged for the product

141

00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,370

without a freemium tier.

142

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,081

It was risky but Ben

Chestnut and co were willing

143

00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,458

to take that risk.

144

00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,168

They would now be able

to offer their tools

145

00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,545

and expertise to a wider audience.

146

00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,839

The fact that Mailchimp is

still around today is proof

147

00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,425

that a freemium offering

even late in the game

148

00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,344

is by no means a death sentence.

149

00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,596

In fact, it's quite the contrary.

150

00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,639

In a world where most email

marketing solutions stick

151

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,433

with the same branding for years.

152

00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,437

Mailchimp also stands out for

being bold, quirky and fun.

153

00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,271

Over the years,

154

00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,566

they have had several

successful marketing campaigns,

155

00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,776

but about five years ago,

156

00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,862

they had a stroke of marketing genius.

157

00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,156

At the time, many people

were curious about Mailchimp

158

00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,283

and what it actually brought to the table.

159

00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,619

In response, the company

created a one of a kind

160

00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,287

brand awareness campaign

161

00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,707

to fill that all two

obvious curiosity gap.

162

00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,541

It was dubbed.

163

00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,918

Did you mean Mailchimp?

164

00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,712

To get the campaign up

and running Mailchimp

165

00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,382

crafted many different

sites along with rich,

166

00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,301

well thought out promotional

social media videos

167

00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,596

from "calimp" to

"failchips" and "jailblimp."

168

00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,598

Whenever someone looked

up these quirky terms

169

00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,725

or mistyped Mailchimp,

170

00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,019

they would bump right

into the main website,

171

00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,813

occupying many different advertising

172

00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,357

and social channels meant

that Mailchimp was everywhere.

173

00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,567

Creative minded businesses might be.

174

00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,694

Without having to use their real name,

175

00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,405

but how do you run a creative company?

176

00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,740

What's the secret ingredient to success

177

00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,912

Well, as Ben Chestnut says,

it's about the people.

178

00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,372

\- People power companies.

179

00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,542

It's these people,

people wanna be creative.

180

00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,459

\- Since its origins,

181

00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,502

Mailchimp has exceeded

182

00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,880

by empowering employees to be themselves.

183

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,299

They even run quirky promotional campaigns

184

00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:09,429

like sending out cat

hats or cats for hats.

185

00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,597

They've established a

very particular brand

186

00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,849

by being different.

187

00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,183

By going against the grain

188

00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,519

of the usual humdrum SAS playbook,

189

00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,938

Mailchimp has invented

their own style guide.

190

00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,898

\- Innovation is when you

don't have a playbook.

191

00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,191

And so if you don't have a playbook,

192

00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,861

by definition you're onto

something really cool.

193

00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,946

\- Additionally, and the

reason you're all here,

194

00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,657

Mailchimp knows the answer to defeat spam,

195

00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,160

in 2017 Ben Chestnut went on CNBC

196

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,786

and was asked the question.

197

00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,205

\- How do you get past spam, a spam filter?

198

00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,707

\- His answer was simple.

199

00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,334

\- Be useful and people

will like your content

200

00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,961

and not block you.

201

00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,838

\- Of course, this is easier said than done

202

00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,591

but Mailchimp understands

this and they understand that

203

00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:50,094

if their users don't then

growth will be stagnant.

204

00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,888

Through their blog and help docs,

205

00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,139

you can understand strategies

206

00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,641

and tactics on how to be useful,

207

00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,227

but perhaps the best tool

that Mailchimp offers

208

00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,562

is leading by example.

209

00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,650

Mailchimp is one tool that truly helps

210

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,028

SAS marketers get the job done

211

00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,280

and with only a pinch of their resources,

212

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,990

but there's a caveat to all of this.

213

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,159

Even with an effective tool like Mailchimp

214

00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,161

your campaigns will still hit a snag

215

00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,749

if you aren't creative, relevant

and yeah sometimes quirky.

216

00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,834

The modern email recipients are savvy

217

00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,795

and well versed in what

makes a good email.

218

00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,380

And the only way to lure them in

219

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,550

is to be truly authentic

and value focused.

220

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,719

Anything less will

inevitably see the inside

221

00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,887

of a spam folder.

222

00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,721

At present,

223

00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,765

the email marketing spectrum

is looking promising

224

00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,267

and Mailchimp is one of many selections.

225

00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,101

Over the years,

226

00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,396

Mailchimp has expanded beyond

just email marketing services.

227

00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,273

The company out provides website hosting,

228

00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,191

data analysis tools,

229

00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,318

social media management technology

230

00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,362

and dozens of other products.

231

00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,948

It's essentially a full

fledged marketing platform.

232

00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,909

Beyond that innovative works

of integrating email marketing

233

00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,787

with cloud-based and

AI technology suggests

234

00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,332

that the industry will only

get better, more profitable

235

00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,960

and certainly more

accommodating from here on out.

236

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,504

Mailchimp's exact success

circumstances probably

237

00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,713

can't be replicated,

238

00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,132

but whether you choose

them for their services

239

00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,636

or as an example to follow,

you're in good hands,

240

00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,679

do you use Mailchimp

241

00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,931

or a different email marketing provider?

242

00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,766

Let me know in the comments down below.

243

00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,936

From Paddle, I'm Ben Hillman

and I'll see you next time.

244

00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,188

And please don't send

me to the spam folder.
