# Is the future Passwordless? 1Password's Success

On this episode of Verticals, we explore how 1Password became a major player in the password manager space as well as the question: is the future passwordless?

  * Notes
  * Transcription


How many passwords do you know off the top of your head? To tell you the truth I couldn’t even tell you what my Netflix password is. From banking accounts to online games, and even the hair salon, it's estimated that the[ average person has 100 passwords](https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person).

Passwords are supposed to be long, unique, and complicated all to prevent hackers from breaking in. And don’t forget to change all of them at least once every three months. It would be nice if the world didn’t need passwords. That future might come to fruition, especially with the advent of the password manager.

But which one should you choose? There are a plethora of options like LastPass, Dashlane, Bitwarden (and I’m sure you’ll let me know which one is best), etc. But to me one company seems to stick out.

1Password is a juggernaut in the password management space being [one of Canada’s most valuable tech firms at $6.8 Billion as of January 2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/19/1password-valued-at-6point8-billion-by-investors.html). 1Password has all the resources at its disposal to take over the entire market, but is it ready for a passwordless future? The winner in this space is going to be the company that best balances security with convenience. We'll walk through the origins of the password space, 1Password’s rise as a certified SaaS legend, and finally, whether or not our future truly is passwordless.

### Lessons from the Top

Passwords are a necessary evil. And there really is no way around them if we want to keep our information safe. However, with the average person having around 100 passwords, remembering them all is likely impossible — for most of us. Luckily, we don't have to.

1Password understood this inconvenience all too well, and today is a juggernaut in the password management space. Through its commitment to improvement and customer satisfaction, it became [one of Canada’s most valuable tech firms ](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/19/1password-valued-at-6point8-billion-by-investors.html)at $6.8 billion as of January 2022. What we can, and should, take away from 1Password's story, is that it takes a village to grow. Alignment across your entire company is key.

  * **Commitment to continuous improvement**  
1Password's mission is to ease the tension between security and convenience. And though it’s done a phenomenal job with a powerful product, 1Password knows the job is never done. The company continues to invest in the areas that make the greatest impact based directly on the feedback received from customers.   

  * **Company-wide focus on customer satisfaction**  
Ensuring your customers are satisfied is something every company strives for; however, 1Password goes beyond having a specialized customer support team. The entire company is directly involved in understanding its customer needs. Every employee at 1Password, including directors, spends time each week to answer customer support queries. Development of its product is directly based on this feedback.   
Making this focus a company-wide effort ensures every department, thoroughly and personally, gains a deep level of understanding. And in turn, they’re able to sell better, market better, develop better, etc.   

  * **Thinking ahead**  
Things are ever changing in technology. So you have to be able to evolve along with it, and if possible stay ahead of it. 1Password has adapted to touch ID and face ID technologies. They’re also forming key partnerships for a possible passwordless future, even as threatening as that may sound for a password company. It’s preparing — now — to ensure it stays in the game.


### **Background**

A [password is defined as](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/password): something that enables one to pass or gain admission, such as a sequence of characters required for access to a computer system. And believe it or not, passwords have been around for a while — at least 2,000 years.

Early uses included [ciphers, wax seals, and mask letters](https://6park.news/massachusetts/what-did-people-do-to-protect-information-before-passwords-by-erik-brown-march-2022.html) in order to protect information. American Prohibition saw the rise of “speakeasy” bars where alcohol was distributed illegally. Patrons who obtained a card or phrase could offer the password in order to get inside and imbibe to their heart’s content.

But perhaps no person is more important to the modern use of passwords than the American computer scientist known as [Fernando J Corbató.](http://wired.com/2012/01/computer-password/) While at MIT in the 1960s, Corbató and other researchers built a time-sharing computer called Compatible Time-Sharing System (or CTSS). CTSS is responsible for many foundational tools that tech and SaaS folks use today like e-mail, instant messaging, and file sharing. The issue to be solved for CTSS was that there were multiple terminals used by multiple people who all had their own set of files.

At the time, there were methods like knowledge-based authentication (information only the user would know like, “what is your mother’s maiden name?”), but this would require the computer to store personal information which users may not want to share. So instead, users were assigned a username and password.

![VRT-S01-E05-Password_Manager-2](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/Yzg5MGQ5YTctODAwNy00N2Q0LWJlNWMtNGFhYmM5MjM0YTg1_vrt-s01-e05-password_manager-2.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=3840)

The one fatal flaw, that Corbató himself has admitted, is security was not put at a premium. This gave way to careless hacks and break-ins, like one user requesting files to be printed offline, which meant one could simply reveal all of the passwords and log in as his colleagues. They probably could have used a password manager… While this didn’t result in a major security breach, it’s indicative of one of the core issues with passwords themselves. They rely on the individual’s memory, and also, not accidentally giving up their secret code in a phishing attack (a fraudulent practice used to reveal personal information). In order to win in the space, the companies that would arise would have to focus on ensuring password managers were secure.

### **Early Leaders**

Today, all [password managers must use](https://www.makeuseof.com/are-password-managers-safe-or-not/) high-level encryption standards, meaning all your information is converted into secret code in order to mask its true meaning (kind of like how cyphers were used in the times before computers). Additionally, password managers rarely, if ever, store your master password. This means even the employees of a major firm cannot access your master key.

Security was important, but in the early days it wasn’t the number-one priority. Convenience was key. In 2000, Siber Systems released their flagship product: [RoboForm](https://www.roboform.com/about). RoboForm first started out as an automatic form filler, but soon after implementation, the founders realized that users were typically using the product to fill out a very specific form: passwords. This provoked them to go all in on the space and just like that, the password manager race was off.

[Dave Teare and Roustem Karimov](https://1password.com/company/) got into the game shortly thereafter. In 2005, the two founded AgileBits a company which helped folks build websites. While doing this, they realized how difficult it was to keep up with passwords. On May 19th, 2006, they uploaded the first-ever version of [1Password](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/in-its-first-funding-in-14-years-1password-raises-200m-series-a-led-by-accel/#:~:text=1Password%20started%20in%20Toronto%20in,of%20keeping%20up%20with%20passwords.) for Mac.

Shortly after launch, users started sending feedback. Teare and Karimov couldn't have been more excited. They regularly pushed out new versions of 1Password with bug fixes and additional features, which resulted in more downloads and even more feedback. They took that information and refined the tool further and further, releasing 1Password for iOS and Windows in 2010. There is perhaps no better indicator of 1Password’s success than the fact that for the first 14 years of existence, they were entirely customer-funded.

In order to accelerate growth, 1Password finally decided to raise [$200-million](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/fourteen-years-after-launching-1password-takes-first-funding-a-200m-series-a/) in 2019 and another $100 million in 2021. This took the company's valuation to [$2 billion](https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/27/1password-raises-100-million-in-funding-based-on-a-2-billion-valuation-to-continue-enterprise-expansion/). With 90,000 paying customers and $120 million in annual recurring revenue, the sky was the limit for 1Password…

And then, in January of 2022, they closed another round of funding that brought in [$620 million](https://www.thesoftwarereport.com/1password-valued-at-6-8-billion-in-funding-round-highlighted-by-hollywood-superheroes/). Investors included superstars like Robert Downey, Jr., Scarlett Johansson, and Ryan Reynolds. Their valuation was pumped to $6.8 billion.

![VRT-S01-E05-Password_Manager-4](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/NDg1ZTU4ODQtZGQ5Ny00MDBiLTlkM2UtODU1OGViNjg2NDcz_vrt-s01-e05-password_manager-4.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=3840)

### **Reasons for success**

1Password's mission is to ease the tension between security and convenience. It has recently added powerful capabilities to an already sterling product offering — a testament of its commitment to continuous improvement. Over the past year alone, the platform has launched [Psst](https://blog.1password.com/psst-item-sharing/)! (a secure way to transfer items within 1Password), [Events API](https://blog.1password.com/introducing-events-api/) (a way to give security and IT teams greater visibility), and [1Password for Safari](https://blog.1password.com/1password-for-safari/).

But perhaps no greater element to 1Password's success is its focus on [customer satisfaction](https://dteare.medium.com/14-years-of-growth-the-1password-story-fbbf58ebe28b). 1Password receives _all_ feedback, good and bad, in good faith. Today, [every employee at 1Password, including its directors, spends time each week answering customer support queries](https://blog.1password.com/feedback-first-development/#:~:text=Every%20person%20at%201Password%2C%20including%20the%20directors%2C%20spends%20time%20each%20week%20answering%20customers%20who%20write%20in%20for%20support.%20The%20entire%20company%20makes%20an%20effort%20to%20understand%20what%20people%20like%20about%20the%20product%2C%20what%20needs%20improvement%2C%20and%20how%20people%20use%201Password.). The entire company makes an effort to understand what people like about the product, what needs improvement, and how people use 1Password. The product team takes a closer look at the results and quantifies it. Developers then make judgements and decisions based on that feedback. If the product and design teams need specific or pointed feedback, or if the problem is more pronounced, the company [interviews people who use 1Password the most](https://blog.1password.com/feedback-first-development/). It even hosts customers in its offices to demonstrate new and upcoming features.

An interesting wrinkle in all of this is that 1Password does not offer a freemium tier. Frequent viewers of the show know that pretty much every successful company we’ve discussed thus far has had a free offering. It’s a massive opportunity to grow your company if you do it right. In fact, competitor LastPass came under fire recently for [downgrading their free offering](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/lastpass-free-service-will-add-a-major-limitation-next-month/). Users were forced into choosing to access LastPass on their mobile or desktop device. Additionally, support was kneecapped. Customers became so upset that in an [Android Authority poll](https://www.androidauthority.com/lastpass-free-survey-1201723/) of over 8000 users said that four out of five folks would move to a competitor.

It’s important to remember that freemium, while effective, is an acquisition channel, not a monetization strategy. 1Password wasn’t suffering from restricted growth, so they didn’t really need freemium. For more, [check out our own research on the matter](/recur/all/blog/freemium/).

Being close to customers, developing a powerful product, and remaining true to founding values are the ingredients that have contributed to 1Password's success. 1Password is well positioned to drive continued growth. The company said it plans to triple its engineering and customer support teams, build out the Events API functionality, and finance more acquisitions. Ultimately 1Password will thrive as long as it dances that line between security and convenience.

And this line is an important one to focus on. According to Ann Johnson, Corporate VP of Security at Microsoft, [“The user and the password is the weakest link in your security system.”](https://youtu.be/faU_d7DqoiY?t=654) she also says [70% of phishing attacks today](https://youtu.be/faU_d7DqoiY?t=638) are caused by stolen passwords. It’s why certain protocols must be put in place that can sometimes result in a dip in convenience.

You might already be familiar with 2 Factor Authentication, but in simplistic terms, 2FA is an extra step used to verify if a user is who they say they are. This is done with a text code, an authenticator app, or verification in another app. 1Password employs this, and it’s pretty much industry standard for all password managers. But while 2FA adds a layer of security, it also adds extra friction to logging in. While this friction is inherently good, it can get annoying. So how does 1Password stay secure but eliminate these extra steps?

In June 2022, [CEO Jeff Shiner announced ](https://blog.1password.com/1password-is-joining-the-fido-alliance/)that 1Password had joined the [FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/). FIDO is essentially a consortium of leading tech companies, government agencies, and other industries that was launched in 2013 with the goal of eliminating the use of passwords on websites, devices, and apps.

Users can already use [Touch ID](https://support.1password.com/touch-id-mac/) to unlock 1Password on their mac computer or Face ID to unlock 1Password on their mobile device. Additionally, 1Password has formed strategic partnerships with folks like Yubico where users can insert a [“Yubikey”](https://support.1password.com/security-key/) or USB device that you then touch to complete 2FA. Other password managers have followed suit and with this trend, maybe the future is passwordless after all.

### **Summary**

Picture a world where you don’t have to wrack your brain in order to log in to any account. It’s even simpler than using your password manager. Imagine if you didn’t even have to remember one? All you do is touch a finger pad here or look into an eye scanner there. [Some banks have even started using voice recognition software.](https://www.google.com/search?q=banks+using+voice+recognition&amp;oq=banks+using+voice+rec&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0i512j69i57j0i22i30j0i390l3.2508j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)

I believe we will get there some day and [security experts agree](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/one-step-closer-to-a-passwordless-future/). But there is still a lot of ground to make up. According to Bitwarden, [over half of 2000 consumers surveyed said they rely on their memory to manage passwords. ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR8taxCTJGfJjQgeeIgoB9aoyl6COap1KlesP5QfwPyhBNi4reM6R0KwUfF4V9gzGFmkhxHLik5seBL/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000&amp;slide=id.g11b2737de95_0_325)And a third said they use a pen and paper.

![VRT-S01-E05-Password_Manager-1](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/MjgzYmFmOWQtZDUwZS00NzhhLWEwMmMtNTQ1YzRkMjdjNmYy_vrt-s01-e05-password_manager-1.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=3840)

While I may not lose any personal information if I fall victim to a phishing attack while [resetting my password](https://www.campaigner.com/blog/focus/all-you-need-to-know-about-password-reset-emails/) for Netlfix, it’s in my best practices, for the sake of my other passwords, to have some sort of security. It’s more important for SaaS companies to ensure password security is top of the line especially considering how detrimental a customer data leak can be.

It's still too early to predict how long 1Password's reign will last. But if Jeff Shiner and company really want to remain at the top, then they have to keep innovating to fend off competitors. Facing off against juggernauts like Apple and Google who provide their own free offerings, can only last so long without moving the needle.

Ultimately, any company that wishes to topple 1Password has to be, at the very least, capable of matching 1Password's core offering. And most importantly, it has to be adequately prepared for a passwordless future. Which company do you think that will be? Or will 1Password remain on top? Let us know what you think.

00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,230

\- Two-factor authentication.

2

00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,460

\- Auto fill as a login.

3

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,380

\- Too many passwords for

all your different systems.

4

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,730

\- So how many passwords do you know

5

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,350

off the top of your head?

6

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,300

To tell you the truth,

I couldn't even tell you

7

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,070

what my Netflix password is.

8

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,290

From banking accounts to online games,

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,970

and even the hair salon,

00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,180

it's estimated that the average

person has a 100 passwords.

11

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,910

It'd be nice if the world

didn't need passwords.

12

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,190

And that future might

come to fruition soon,

13

00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,590

especially with the advent

of the password manager.

14

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,030

I mean, there's a plethora of options,

15

00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,760

whether it's LastPass,

Dashlane, Bitwarden.

16

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,080

I'm sure you'll let me

know which one's best

in the comments down below.

18

00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,160

But to me, one company seems to stick out.

19

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,899

\- And it's called 1Password.

20

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,749

\- 1Password.

21

00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:38,977

\- The 1Password App.

22

00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:40,560

\- 1Password is a juggernaut

23

00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,970

in the password management space.

24

00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,040

Being one of Canada's

most valuable tech firms

25

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,340

at $6.8 billion as of 2022.

26

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,860

1Password has all of the

resources at its disposal

27

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,350

to take over the entire market,

28

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,540

but are they ready for

a passwordless future?

29

00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,430

The winner in this space

is going to be the company

30

00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,070

that best balances

security with convenience.

31

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,420

And we're gonna walk through the origins

32

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,190

of the password space,

33

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,810

1Password's rise as a

certified SAS legend,

34

00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,450

and finally, we'll talk

about if our future truly

35

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,040

is passwordless.

36

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,293

I'm Ben Hillman, and this is Verticals.

37

00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:14,107

(upbeat music)

38

00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,500

A password is defined as

something that enables one to pass

39

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,610

or gain admission,

40

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,740

such as a sequence of characters required

41

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,270

for access to a computer system.

42

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,690

Early uses included ciphers,

wax seals, and mask letters

43

00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,700

in order to protect information.

44

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,310

American Prohibition saw

the rise of speakeasy bars

45

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,770

where alcohol was distributed illegally.

46

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,720

Patrons who obtained a card or phrase

47

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,270

could offer the password

in order to get inside

48

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,040

and imbibed to their heart's content.

49

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,830

But perhaps no person is more

important to the modern use

50

00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,080

of passwords than the

American computer scientist

51

00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,150

known as Fernando J. Corbató.

52

00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,370

\- Dr. Corbató, maybe you

can put this whole business

53

00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,630

in perspective for us.

54

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,780

\- While at MIT in the 1960s,

Corbató and other researchers

55

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,520

built a time sharing computer

56

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,210

called Compatible Time

Sharing System, or CTSS.

57

00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,760

CTSS is responsible for

many foundational tools

58

00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,130

that tech and SAS folks

use today, like email,

59

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,930

instant messaging, and file sharing.

60

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,730

The issue to be solved for CTSS

61

00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,080

was that there were multiple terminals

62

00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,290

used by multiple people who

all had their own set of files.

63

00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,670

At the time, there were methods

64

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,620

like knowledge-based authentication,

65

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,270

information only the user would know,

66

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,460

like what is your mother's maiden name.

67

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,170

But this would require the computer

68

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,760

to store a personal information,

69

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,214

which users may not wanna share.

70

00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:25,470

(indistinct)

71

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,640

\- So instead, users were assigned

a username and a password.

72

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,190

The one fatal flaw that

Corbató himself has admitted

73

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,440

is security was not put at a premium.

74

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,360

This gave way to careless

hacks and break-ins,

75

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,360

like one user requesting

files be printed offline,

76

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,730

which meant they could simply

reveal all the passwords

77

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,650

and log in as their colleagues.

78

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,690

Probably could have used a

password manager back then.

79

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,060

While this didn't result

in a major security breach,

80

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,070

it is indicative of one of the core issues

81

00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,810

with passwords themselves.

82

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,090

It relies on an individual's memory,

83

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,760

but also not accidentally

giving up their secret code

84

00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,700

whether it's written down

or in a phishing attack,

85

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,440

otherwise known as a fraudulent practice

86

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,360

used to reveal personal information.

87

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,770

In order to win in this space,

88

00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,570

the companies that would

arise would've to focus

89

00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,213

on ensuring password managers were secure.

90

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,060

Today, all password managers

91

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,280

must use high level encryption standards,

92

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,150

meaning all your information

is converted into secret code.

93

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,940

Security is important,

but in the early days,

94

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,550

it wasn't really the number one priority.

95

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,750

Convenience was key.

96

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,255

In 2000, Siber Systems released

their flagship product,

97

00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:29,088

RoboForm.

98

00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:30,210

\- And you just click fill form.

99

00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,380

\- Look at that. Whoa.

100

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,930

\- RoboForm first started out

as our automatic form filler.

101

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,720

But soon after implementation,

the founders realized

102

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,610

that users were typically

using their product

103

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,150

to fill out a very

specific form, passwords.

104

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,130

This provoked them to

go all in on the space.

105

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,313

And just like that, the

password manager race was off.

106

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,580

Dave Teare & Roustem

Karimov got into the game

107

00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,750

shortly thereafter.

108

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,180

In 2005, the two founded AgileBits,

109

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,640

a company which helped

folks build websites.

110

00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,920

While doing this, they

realized how difficult it was

111

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,570

to keep up with passwords.

112

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,200

On May 19th, 2006, they

uploaded the first ever version

113

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,270

of 1Password for Mac.

114

00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,210

Shortly after launch, users

started sending feedback.

115

00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,150

Teare and Karimov couldn't

have been more excited.

116

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,460

They regularly pushed out

new versions of 1Password

117

00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,830

with bug fixes and additional features,

118

00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,400

which resulted in more downloads

and even more feedback.

119

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,560

They took that information

and refined the tool

120

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,880

further and further,

121

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,853

releasing 1Password for

iOS and Windows in 2010.

122

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,960

There's perhaps no better

indicator of 1Password success

123

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,960

than the fact that for the

first 14 years of existence,

124

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,180

they were entirely customer-funded.

125

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,500

In order to accelerate growth,

126

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,310

1Password finally decided to

raise $200 million in 2019,

127

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,220

and another $100 million in 2021.

128

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,400

This took the company's

valuation to $2 billion.

129

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,550

With 90,000 paying

customers and $120 million

130

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,110

in annual recurring revenue,

131

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,910

the sky was the limit for 1Password.

132

00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,220

And they didn't stop there.

133

00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,800

In 2022, they closed

another round of funding

134

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,663

that brought in $620 million.

135

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,960

Investors included superstars

like Robert Downey Jr.

136

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,030

Scarlett Johansson, and Ryan Reynolds.

137

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,480

\- Okay, well, how many of you

have downloaded 1Password?

138

00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,843

\- Their valuation was

pumped to $6.8 billion.

139

00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,130

The reason 1Password has

found so much success

140

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,320

comes down to its mission

to ease the tension

141

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,810

between security and convenience.

142

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,300

Over the past year alone,

the platform has launched

143

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,240

a secure way to transfer

items within 1Password,

144

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,060

Events API, a way to give

security and IT teams

145

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,500

greater visibility,

146

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,330

and 1Password for Safari.

147

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,120

But perhaps no greater

element to 1Password success,

148

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,490

it's its focus on customer satisfaction.

149

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,820

Today, every employee at

1Password, including its directors,

150

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,700

spends time each week answering

customer support queries.

151

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,190

The product team then takes

a closer look at the results

152

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,240

and they quantify it.

153

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,370

Developers then make

judgements and decisions

154

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,510

based on that feedback.

155

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,520

If the product and design

teams need specific

156

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,670

or pointed feedback, or if the

problem is more pronounced,

157

00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,300

company interviews people

who use 1Password the most.

158

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,070

An interesting wrinkle in all of this,

159

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,520

is that 1Password does

not offer a freemium tier.

160

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,630

Frequent viewers of the show

161

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,550

know that pretty much

every successful company

162

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,580

who we've discussed thus

far has had a free offering.

163

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,800

Competitor LastPass

came under fire recently

164

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,570

for downgrading their free offering.

165

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,040

Users were forced into choosing

166

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,200

if they could access

LastPass on their mobile

167

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,400

or their desktop device.

168

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,050

Customers became so upset

169

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,560

that in an Android Authority

poll of over 8,000 users,

170

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,420

four to five folks said

that they would move

171

00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,293

to a competitor.

172

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,050

So wonder what competitor that might be.

173

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,330

It's important to remember

that freemium, while effective,

174

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,720

is an acquisition channel,

not a monetization strategy.

175

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,060

1Password wasn't suffering

from restricted growth,

176

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,890

so they didn't really need freemium.

177

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,310

For more, you can check out

our own research on the matter.

178

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,860

Being close to customers,

developing a powerful product,

179

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,810

and remaining true to founding values

180

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,430

are the ingredients that have contributed

181

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,580

to 1Password success.

182

00:06:52,652 --> 00:06:55,230

1Password is well positioned

to drive continued growth.

183

00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,300

The company said it plans

to triple its engineering

184

00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,890

and customer support teams,

185

00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,930

build out the events API functionality,

186

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,910

and finance more acquisitions.

187

00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,620

Ultimately, 1Password will thrive

188

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,560

as long as it dances that

line between security

189

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,060

and convenience.

190

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,490

So let's talk a little bit

more about that convenience,

191

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,280

because this line is an

important one to focus on.

192

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,710

According to Ann Johnson,

Corporate VP of Security

193

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,610

at Microsoft-

194

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,740

\- The user and the password

are the weakest link

195

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,760

in your security system.

196

00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,920

\- It's why certain protocols

must be put in place

197

00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,350

that can sometimes result

in a dip in convenience.

198

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,520

You might already be familiar

199

00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,050

with two-factor authentication.

200

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,830

But in simplistic terms, 2FA

is an extra step used to verify

201

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,050

if a user is who they say they are.

202

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,520

This is done with a text code

203

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,060

and authenticator app, or a

verification in another app.

204

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,260

1Password employs this,

205

00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,850

and it's pretty much industry standard

206

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,440

for all password managers.

207

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,140

But while 2FA adds a layer of security,

208

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,990

it also adds extra

friction when logging in.

209

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,700

So how does 1Password stay secure

210

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,860

but eliminate these extra steps?

211

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,620

Well, in June of 2022, CEO Jeff Shiner

212

00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,890

announced that 1Password had

joined the FIDO Alliance.

213

00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,800

FIDO is essentially a consortium

of leading tech companies,

214

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,020

government agencies, and other industries

215

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,690

that launched in 2013 with

the goal of eliminating

216

00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,200

the use of passwords on

websites, devices, and apps.

217

00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,820

Users can already use their fingerprint

218

00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,130

to unlock 1Password on their computer,

219

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,760

or face ID to unlock 1Password

on their mobile device.

220

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,070

Additionally, 1Password has

formed strategic partnerships

221

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,100

with folks like Yubico, where

you can insert a Yubikey,

222

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,490

or a USB device, that you

then touch to complete 2FA.

223

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,350

Other password managers

have followed suit.

224

00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,090

And with this trend,

225

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,270

maybe the future is

passwordless after all.

226

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,350

I want you to picture a world

227

00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,760

where you don't have to rack your brain

228

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,530

in order to log into any account.

229

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,320

Imagine if you didn't

even have to remember one.

230

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,150

All you do is touch a finger pad here,

231

00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,340

or look into an eye scanner there.

232

00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,690

Some banks have even started using

233

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,730

voice recognition software.

234

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,740

But there's a lot of ground to make up.

235

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,980

According to Bitwarden, over

half of 2,000 consumer surveys

236

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,950

said they relied on their

memory to manage passwords.

237

00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,770

A third said they still use pen and paper.

238

00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,480

It's more important for SAS companies

239

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,330

to ensure password security

is top of the line,

240

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,980

especially considering how detrimental

241

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,200

a customer data leak can be.

242

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,050

Ultimately, any company that

wishes to topple 1Password

243

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,410

has to be adequately prepared

for a passwordless future.

244

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,000

Which company do you think that'll be?

245

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,400

Let us know what you think

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,860

From Paddle, I'm Ben Hillman,

247

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,363

and I think the future

might be passwordless.

248

00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:25,113
