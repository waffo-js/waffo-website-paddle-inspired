00:00:00:05 - 00:00:11:23

Steve Cerasoli

Hey everybody, and welcome to fix that funnel. Today I am joined by a very special guest, the founder and CEO of the aptly titled App Masters. It's the app master himself, Steve Young. Steve, thanks for being here.

00:00:12:01 - 00:00:14:16

Steve Young

Steve. Thanks for having me again. Super excited for.

00:00:14:16 - 00:00:20:05

Steve Cerasoli

Sure. It's always good to be on a call with another Steve. I don't know when the last time I've been on a call with Steve before is, but.

00:00:20:05 - 00:00:23:19

Steve Young

You're too young to be called the Steve because I thought he'd gone away.

00:00:24:06 - 00:00:35:12

Steve Cerasoli

Exactly. Cool. But yeah, let's, let's just start off talking a little bit about your history in the app growth space and like where you landed with App Masters, what got you interested in the whole space. Like what went into apps.

00:00:35:14 - 00:00:51:23

Steve Young

Yeah. My son who's now about to be 17, he was only 18 months at the time. So almost two. And he was learning. We were doing all these duck, duck, goose the that's the, the, the brand of the company. But he was using the iPad and he's just learning. I was like, oh my God, this is really working for him.

00:00:52:01 - 00:01:12:00

Steve Young

And so that inspired me to try to create more kids apps. And that led me to this journey about coding and learning, teaching myself how to code. I had some experience coding. Anyways, and so I built my first app is starting to make some money $500,500 to $1000 a month. And Steve is back in 2013, by the way.

00:01:12:00 - 00:01:31:10

Steve Young

So it was ancient times and it was easy to get exposure and everything else for the app. But I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur. Did not know what that journey would look like. But in 2013 I started, you know, obviously consuming a lot of podcasts at the time. And I was like, I love pod. Why is there a podcast just about apps?

00:01:31:12 - 00:01:46:22

Steve Young

Why don't I just do that? And, you know, at the time I thought the business just general business podcasts were crowded. I thought podcasting was so crowded that I know it was just a business like now. Everybody, you know, like everybody has a podcast. But anyways, I so I started the podcast, I interviewed some of my heroes in the space.

00:01:46:22 - 00:02:10:23

Steve Young

So Dan counsel from clear, Paul Hadad from tweet Tweet Bot I interview the co-founder of Shazam, Chris Barton. So I just trying to learn from my heroes in the space to see how they did it. And then I built an audience through that journey. That audience started coming to me for app marketing help. And so six months after starting the podcast, end up leaving my job, my corporate job, to do this full time.

00:02:10:23 - 00:02:27:14

Steve Young

And so now we have a team of 30 and close to 30 people, and we specialize in it. So it's a monetization. This is why I'm here. And also that ads obviously. But yeah, that's how the journey started. Just by hitting record with the silly microphone getting going.

00:02:27:16 - 00:02:47:22

Steve Cerasoli

That's amazing man. That's a that's actually a super inspiring way to start out with, especially with like the kids apps and stuff. It's a super, super interesting way to get into the into the whole app space. Cool. Let's jump into, the benefits of web two app. So basically you can purchase, assign a rebel through the App Store, obviously, and you can purchase it on the web.

00:02:48:03 - 00:02:55:15

Steve Cerasoli

We're going to, but we're about to jump into like an onboarding flow on the web. But, what are some of the benefits of web app in general? Like why are people doing this?

00:02:55:17 - 00:03:11:16

Steve Young

Well, obviously. So there's a couple of things. One, the web users tend to retain more. They're probably willing to pay a higher price, you know, 20 bucks on the app. So we're like what, the 20 bucks on the web? We're like, okay, no big deal. So that's one the the other thing is retention is higher on the SATs.

00:03:11:16 - 00:03:36:07

Steve Young

I've read like retention is a lot higher on the web versus the app side of things too. And lastly, come on Steve, we get work money. We don't got to pay the 15 to 30% to Apple anymore. We just have to pay the 3 or 5 4% to paddle and whatever the percentages. But it's a lot more beneficial as a business owner if we're using a tool like a payment platform like paddle versus a payment platform like Apple two.

00:03:36:12 - 00:03:56:20

Steve Young

And the last thing is it opens up your audience even broader. So when you're running media campaigns, you don't, you know, they're not cannibalizing each other. The app installs in the web two app campaigns. They're actually the web two app campaigns brought in the amount of users. And the cool thing that I've seen from my clients is we get Android users.

00:03:56:22 - 00:04:05:03

Steve Young

See, it's hard to get Android users to pay, but with the web two app campaign, that's where you find your Android users, your high paying Android users as well.

00:04:05:05 - 00:04:12:05

Steve Cerasoli

That's awesome. There's also the attribution element to that. I've heard, like the you get a lot better, a lot better data to do. You want to comment on that?

00:04:12:07 - 00:04:21:13

Steve Young

This is my show. Let me say that okay. Don't forget. Lastly, I want to say the attribution part of it. It's a lot easier that way to

00:04:21:15 - 00:04:40:22

Steve Cerasoli

And and then, yeah, some crazy news, actually. It's like perfect timing for today. Apple just now required, to allow they allow developers to link to external payment options without fees or restrictions. Where I know that's been a huge, huge reason why people are, you know, getting into these web two app flows. As someone so close to the space, like what are your initial reactions to this?

00:04:40:22 - 00:04:45:00

Steve Cerasoli

And like, what does this mean for the whole whole app growth world?

00:04:45:02 - 00:05:01:01

Steve Young

It's going to be insane. I'm very interested. Let's just say I'm intrigued, right? Like, you know, very few things get me intrigued in terms of like what I've seen in this space, but I'm very intrigued because I can see, like, the thing that I wanted to quickly test off the jump at the top of my head was, what if we can give a discount?

00:05:01:06 - 00:05:16:09

Steve Young

Like, hey, you know, we seen these on the web where if you sign up for a year, that's the usual one. You sign up for a year, you get a discount. But what if it was like, hey, you know, save 15% and then by checking out on the web, can we then we're still making more money as an app developer.

00:05:16:09 - 00:05:34:12

Steve Young

So I think that's I still feel like the App Store makes it a lot easier for us to check out. So I think the conversion rates are a lot higher if you just use Apple's payments. But that's why I was like, if you can give them incentive to check out on the web, that might be easier. And it's easy and even easier.

00:05:34:12 - 00:05:52:01

Steve Young

I know, Steve, just before we hit record, you said you're all in all these emails now, but it's easier probably, to capture email addresses like real email addresses than what Apple gives us too. So there's some benefits here, and I'm curious to see how developers are using it. But top of my head I was like discount. Like give them a discount if you sign up on the web.

00:05:52:06 - 00:05:59:20

Steve Cerasoli

Yeah, that'd be a great first kind of experiment. And I feel like there's going to be so much experimentation and people trying to make the best out of it. So it's going to be interesting.

00:05:59:21 - 00:06:01:04

Steve Young

We're going to be talking about, yeah.

00:06:01:05 - 00:06:14:16

Steve Cerasoli

It's going to be an interesting month. I'm mean, I'm very excited to see what happens. Cool. So let's actually jump into the onboarding flow of Asana Rebel. Which is the the company we're talking about today. Are you a yoga guy at all? Do you do any yoga?

00:06:14:18 - 00:06:19:14

Steve Young

I do, dude, I do, yes, I do everything. I pretty much cross-train, so I do it all.

00:06:19:17 - 00:06:25:15

Steve Cerasoli

Okay. All right. I'm not much of a yoga guy. I'm like, the least flexible man in the entire world. I have to do the.

00:06:25:19 - 00:06:27:08

Steve Young

I can still do this, Steve.

00:06:27:10 - 00:06:57:19

Steve Cerasoli

Oh my God. I remember doing the presidential fitness test. When they make you, like, try to touch your toes when you do. Yeah. Leaning so bad at it. I was probably the worst in the entire class. So we got our first screen here. So basically when we, we, we start off on this web page here, if we, you know, I, I went to Google and clicked on it, but what are like some ways people would stumble upon this page through like organic search or ads, like go through all the kind of the methods people would probably stumble across across a page like this.

00:06:57:21 - 00:07:15:02

Steve Young

Yeah, I mean, Google ads, you can do I mean, honestly, you can have a link in bio type of thing, and then meta ads is how normal people are using it. But I think, you know, we tested Google ads where we just took them to our homepage. We saw like no sales, and we spent good amount of money, like 2 or $3000 on that campaign.

00:07:15:07 - 00:07:43:14

Steve Young

And so I rather send them to a page like this, take them to this journey. I know with fitness apps, like certain apps are all different, but I picked out this fitness apps because you're going to have a long onboarding, right? I went through this already and you can experience that and it actually helps. So that's what we've seen too, Steve, is fitness apps generally do better from a conversion perspective by having longer onboarding, because I know most people want to have short onboarding, but fitness apps, it's contradictory because longer onboarding is increase conversions.

00:07:43:17 - 00:07:56:01

Steve Cerasoli

Yeah, people like that customization and like they like actually filling out all the information about themselves for fitness app and kind of tailoring the experience themselves. It feels like a it feels like it's kind of making the app customized for you.

00:07:56:03 - 00:08:12:18

Steve Young

This page could be just because, you know, we both probably clicked on the same link, but it was a branded search. So maybe they're taking their users to this page because they're like, hey, you're branded search. So I'm going to take you to this page. But ultimately, if you're getting cold traffic, you might want to talk about a song, a red bull a little bit.

00:08:12:18 - 00:08:25:18

Steve Young

Add some social proof, which we'll see further down the onboarding, but you might want to have a little bit of social proof to remind users what they do, similar to what you might have in your own home page, and then get them to like, hit continue and something like that.

00:08:25:19 - 00:08:45:00

Steve Cerasoli

Awesome. And then, yeah, the first thing I noticed on this first page here, you get this kind of like big gap right here, like the design of the actual page itself is definitely interesting. But on mobile, like mobile web, I pulled up this same page and it looks great on mobile web, like, it looks, you know, it looks like a very friendly, welcoming mobile screen.

00:08:45:22 - 00:08:54:00

Steve Cerasoli

Is this because they're, like, optimizing for mobile web traffic? I know when we talked to Nathan, he mentioned how, like, mobile web is super popular.

00:08:54:02 - 00:09:11:07

Steve Young

Yeah, it's crazy because even when we've run these campaigns, we see a lot more traction on mobile than we do on the web, too. Most people are, you know, it's not like we're targeting mobile users anyways. So most people are probably on their phones googling stuff versus being on their desktop, like you and I.

00:09:11:09 - 00:09:32:06

Steve Cerasoli

And then I think you touched on it a little bit, but we've seen a ton of different first pages here. Like it's not always what's your gender? There's always there's always an interesting first page to try to capture people's attention. What are your thoughts on this first page here? Is this just kind of like trying to get, like some information on the customer first with the the gender element or why is this the first page they're choosing?

00:09:32:08 - 00:09:47:03

Steve Young

Yeah. I mean, I think it's the easiest. It's a like I like to think about this onboarding as like what's the easiest question I can ask without like offending anybody. So it's kind of like, you know, male, female, non-binary. Cool. You know, I'm not asking for your email address. I'm asking for your name. I'm asking for just simple questions.

00:09:47:09 - 00:10:02:00

Steve Young

So kind of tie them up, ask them for simple yeses before I can get them to start saying no. So I like this again. This is branded. We can't do this through a branded search, but I think if they're doing cold, you might get a different experience.

00:10:02:02 - 00:10:16:15

Steve Cerasoli

Awesome. Cool. So if we select this here so picking three goals. So we see a lot of goal based language I'm sure that there's a lot of goal based language. Like when I signed up on the App Store. It's very similar. They talk a lot about, you know, picking all your different goals that you want to reach.

00:10:17:00 - 00:10:28:03

Steve Cerasoli

And I'm sure it's through. No matter what onboarding flow you're doing, they're probably mentioning something about goals. Why is like, language like this so important for a fitness app? We saw the same thing with MyFitnessPal earlier this season.

00:10:28:05 - 00:10:49:11

Steve Young

What we found with another client was when they selected. I'm just going to pick them, you know, tighten tone body right or lose weight. What we found is sometimes what they pick affects their conversion rate. And so what you can use is that data point to then be like, hey, lose weight and get a tight and fit toned body, right?

00:10:49:11 - 00:11:03:23

Steve Young

And then you know that that's what the audience is looking for. And you know, that's what they're going to subscribe. Higher subscription rates through there. I don't like the picks. I mean, I'm fine with the pick three, but I don't know if they get enough data. Maybe there's too many combinations. But another client, they had a similar thing.

00:11:03:23 - 00:11:19:23

Steve Young

They found that it was a meditation client, but they saw that, you know, when you selected anxiety relief versus sleep better versus, you know, happiness, mindfulness, whatever. So that had the highest trial activation rate, anxiety relief. So that's where it's valuable to.

00:11:20:01 - 00:11:34:11

Steve Cerasoli

I think it's like when someone's filling this out they think like okay, they're going to tailor the app experience to me. But it's also they're getting they're getting a lot of information about their audience. So they can kind of cater their marketing and kind of figure out who that audience actually is. So it's it's, it's super interesting.

00:11:34:13 - 00:11:58:14

Steve Cerasoli

So then we get this other question here, kind of choosing what areas of the body we want to improve. I think this kind of works similarly to the last page, which is all these. And continue. Cool. So what's your fitness level? Another thing I wanted to to, comment on too is, in My Fitness Pal and a lot of other, onboarding flows we've gone through, we see these like interstitial pages where you answer a question and they say like, hey, good job.

00:11:58:14 - 00:12:09:09

Steve Cerasoli

We actually see that, you know, X, Y, and Z. You're like, we're going to give you value through this or we got your back. You're not seeing much of that with Asana Rebel. Is there like an area where is that an area where they can improve?

00:12:09:11 - 00:12:26:14

Steve Young

Absolutely. It's a great point, Steve. I think it's always beneficial because you want to give your users a little bit of break. You don't want them just asking questions. And so you it's a nice blended way of having some social proof and making users look to your point earlier about, oh, I'm they're going to customize this experience for me.

00:12:27:06 - 00:12:39:16

Steve Young

Making them feel like, yeah, you are going to get a customized experience. And so that makes them feel more happy and more willing to pay for your app. Ultimately, when you do ask for that payment.

00:12:39:18 - 00:13:00:04

Steve Cerasoli

Awesome. How much do you spend walking on a typical day. Keep going through here. What is your yoga level. Do you, do you know, I mean you might not just, if you haven't used the actual app, do you know how much of this is actually going into like personalizing the app for the user, or is this mostly being used for what we were saying earlier, like, for marketing reasons?

00:13:00:04 - 00:13:21:23

Steve Young

And I think the bigger and the better apps will use this to customize what you see. And I know, you know, I I'm a big peloton user right now. And they came out with like a weekly workout plan that's based off of. And it's very interesting because it was based off of my goals. And my wife did the same thing, and she has a different goal, and her stuff is a lot harder than mine.

00:13:21:23 - 00:13:47:17

Steve Young

Okay, she's a VS, but I'm more like, okay, I'll take it easy a couple of days. And and so it's very interesting. We, we compared what my weekly plan versus her weekly plan. I usually work out 20 to 40 minutes. She works out, you know 30 to 60 minutes. So she gets more of those like longer workouts where I get more of the shorter workouts and they're using the data of what type of workout workouts I'm using and what type of instructors I like to, you know, workout with.

00:13:47:17 - 00:14:04:21

Steve Young

And they're kind of giving me a weekly plan. So yes, you should be using this data. I mean, ultimately it's a point in time. That's what I think about it, Steve. It's like in the beginning with the with the because we don't have that much data. We're just kind of like getting data. Yeah. And then towards more as we grow in scale, we get multiple millions of users.

00:14:05:00 - 00:14:10:04

Steve Young

Now we're trying to personalize it because we know it's going to increase retention.

00:14:10:06 - 00:14:18:00

Steve Cerasoli

Awesome. Here we go. The diet type. Let's keep going through here. Preference.

00:14:18:02 - 00:14:22:17

Steve Young

It's very long I don't like this Steve. What is my I don't know my height in inches. All I know is feet.

00:14:22:17 - 00:14:24:03

Steve Cerasoli

Yeah I mean I had the same.

00:14:24:03 - 00:14:27:21

Steve Young

Maybe in centimeters but yeah I don't know anything about inches.

00:14:27:23 - 00:14:46:01

Steve Cerasoli

I had to do, I had to, even though it's super I'm 510. I had to pull the calculator out to do it. I was like five times 1260, most at 70in. Yeah. It's like I don't want have to pull my calculator out during an onboarding flow. Me neither. No, it's probably the last thing you should be having. Having your, your customer do.

00:14:46:03 - 00:15:03:07

Steve Cerasoli

Oh, yeah. I wanted to come in on this, too. So we've seen this in a couple other flows as well. Like when we were doing, Blinkist. I think it was a similar thing where it starts off like it starts off pretty vague, like in, like, you know, general questions, like, you know, what's your gender, for example. And then they get kind of more personal as it goes on.

00:15:04:04 - 00:15:16:10

Steve Cerasoli

What is the reason for that? Like this question here. Like what's the last when's the last time you were happy with your body image? You know, I mean, it's like it's got this a very personal question to a lot of people. So it's like waiting to till the end of the flow. Is it to kind of build trust or something like that.

00:15:16:12 - 00:15:35:16

Steve Young

Yeah, absolutely. That's what, you know, kind of we talked about like asking for simple questions that we could just soft toss right now we're like, okay, I think this one is more of like an indication of probably like I think price discrimination is going to be a thing in the future. Now, especially now that we can take users outside of the App Store to buy.

00:15:35:22 - 00:15:53:09

Steve Young

Because if I'm happy with my body image, I might have to show a lower price. But if you it's been more than three years ago that you've been happy with your body image, you might be likely to pay a higher price. Yeah. And so I think that's how we can start to use this data and show different prices to different people.

00:15:53:11 - 00:16:10:20

Steve Cerasoli

That's super interesting. And then we get the goal weight here, which is similar to what we were saying before. Like it's like, go away it. I feel like it might make more sense to like make this like a multiple choice or something like that. I feel like typing it all in is always, cool. And then we're seeing our first bit of social proof here towards the end.

00:16:10:20 - 00:16:19:07

Steve Cerasoli

We've seen a lot of social proof at the beginning of the onboarding flow. Is there the reason why this is at the end, or do you have any preference for where social proof should be in an onboarding flow?

00:16:19:09 - 00:16:32:16

Steve Young

I think I like to have social proof everywhere really. Like I like to intermix them, but definitely before you're going to hit them with the payment options, you should have some social proof in there too. This was weird. Why did they ask for password before email? I didn't get that.

00:16:32:19 - 00:16:43:04

Steve Cerasoli

Yeah, because it's the same way. Very interesting. Yeah. It's weird before email and then. Yeah, I want to type my password and I'm like, I was I was also like, are they going to ask me for my email? Is it just.

00:16:43:04 - 00:16:47:00

Steve Young

Going to I know, me too. I had more questions continued.

00:16:47:02 - 00:17:03:21

Steve Cerasoli

Okay, I'm going to do a random email here so we can get for the next page. Okay, cool. Here we get the loading. This loading bar we've seen. This is this is actually super common. This kind of loading bar, a lot of the times it actually stops and asks you to answer more questions before it gets you continuing.

00:17:04:01 - 00:17:19:07

Steve Cerasoli

Obviously, it's like, I don't think the loading bars really actually organized your plan together and everything like that, and figuring out your, your routine and stuff like that. It's probably just a graphic to kind of keep you engaged. But what's the purpose of having something like that.

00:17:19:09 - 00:17:38:03

Steve Young

That's really to, like, give them a break and have that social proof. You saw the social proof, like millions of users, you know, the the ratings on the App Store. So that's really the social proof. And to make users feel like you are actually customizing it. I have data on this, Steve, where you know, one user, one of my clients tested it without the loading.

00:17:38:03 - 00:17:48:11

Steve Young

With the loading, I think it was a slight like 10 to 11% increase with the loading screen too. So it's beneficial to to have even if it does nothing but lets the user wait.

00:17:48:12 - 00:18:02:18

Steve Cerasoli

Now we're we're moving on from the onboarding flow to kind of towards the pricing page. And this is where they're going to try to convert us. So we got this, this discount right off the bat. Is anything sticking out to you on this pricing page here or like with this discount?

00:18:02:20 - 00:18:20:14

Steve Young

Yeah, I would still love to see a little bit more social proof. I know before and afters do really well for fitness apps. I think community does really well for fitness apps too, and that's what we heard from another client. I've also heard that video does really well. Right. So you can see on like any digital course course creators, you will have video, video, testimonials, video everywhere.

00:18:20:18 - 00:18:39:05

Steve Young

And so even on the app side of things we've seen that video. It does actually increase conversions. When you put it on the paywall. So I think here I would probably try to put the a video there. Yeah. Personally I like to do columns when I'm on the web. I think rows work better when you're in the App Store.

00:18:39:10 - 00:19:05:07

Steve Young

But here because we have a more, bigger space. But if they're in the if they're using on their phone anyways, then I keep it the same. If most of your users are mobile users versus desktop users, but on the desktop, because we have more room, it'll be easier for me to compare. And I think what I generally like to do, and I know apps don't do this really well, but I know web products do, is have differentiations like, hey, there's a Sana rebel, plus there's some in a rebel freemium.

00:19:05:07 - 00:19:28:08

Steve Young

And that way, instead of just comparing each I do monthly or yearly, I'm comparing which plan should I take advantage of? One might have community, one might have other features that I don't get. And so I personally, with this whole changes to the Apple Store, I think that's another thing that app developers can do differentiate between basic premium and like platinum versus always just doing monthly and yearly.

00:19:28:08 - 00:19:31:12

Steve Young

Yeah, the only difference between the two, the plans.

00:19:31:14 - 00:19:46:23

Steve Cerasoli

Cool. So if we actually go to our credit card page here where we actually put our checkout page where we put our credit card in, you could see I ran this through a VPN and they're charging in dollars here because I'm in the US. But when I, you know, ran it through a VPN when I was in Europe, they charge in euros.

00:19:47:14 - 00:19:58:14

Steve Cerasoli

If you're in India, they charge you like Indian currency. So they have pretty much everything, like they have localization pretty much everywhere I checked. Do you want to comment a bit on like what's the importance of localized pricing?

00:19:58:16 - 00:20:16:11

Steve Young

Absolutely. Like the purchasing power is completely different off of different countries. And, you know, there's no this is what I would I've been working trying to work with battle on. It's trying to give you give best practices like what should we charge if you are in India should be 10% of us should be 50% should be 25%. We don't know.

00:20:16:13 - 00:20:34:19

Steve Young

And it's just been testing. But what we found in our studies is, you know, when we play around with the pricing and we localize pricing and we make it lower one, you know, I don't know why. You see, I hate seeing the Euro sign. You know, I hate seeing s optimizer, you know, I want to see that Z.

00:20:34:19 - 00:20:52:06

Steve Young

All right. That Z is more powerful. But anyways. So one, you want to see the currency that you're used to pain painting. Secondly, you're going to have to figure out the right pricing is not 3935, 99 is completely in the US. It's completely different than 3599 in India. As an example.

00:20:52:08 - 00:21:11:02

Steve Cerasoli

Yeah, it's that difference between cosmetic localization where you're just doing you're just changing it. The currency symbol versus like actual real localization where you're changing the price based on where people are actually buying from and what their purchasing power is. It's cool. And then we can talk about a little bit about another area which is kind of paddles.

00:21:11:02 - 00:21:34:09

Steve Cerasoli

Bread and butter here is offering multiple payment methods. So we see they got credit card debit card here. They also offer PayPal. Could they be doing more here. We've heard a couple different things where it's like some people are like the more the merrier. Like and then there's also also other people who are kind of like, well, you know, you kind of want to experiment and see, like what age demographics your, your audience is because they choose different things.

00:21:34:09 - 00:21:40:18

Steve Cerasoli

Or what do you think? Are you like a the more the merrier kind of guy or do you think you could kind of experiment?

00:21:40:19 - 00:21:55:09

Steve Young

Yeah, I think you do definitely experiment with like maybe even Apple Pay. I mean, can you click on credit and debit and see if, like all those Apple Pay options, maybe because you're not on the phone, you won't see it, but definitely on the phone. Like I know Apple Pay. I always like that versus like anything else. And I'm putting my credit card.

00:21:55:14 - 00:22:20:16

Steve Young

I think the other thing that I would like to see on this page, that works really well, it's still more social proof testimonials, something that says, hey, there are others just like you that have seen results. So again, I like to I come well I studied how about that from the digital creators. You know like the course creators and they I like adopting because they're just that's how they make their money and they can charge and they have web flows.

00:22:20:22 - 00:22:46:15

Steve Young

And you will see like testimonials on these credit card pages so that you can get people to ultimately purchase. And then the other thing that I know works really well on the app side of things too, is like, I want an exit intent and see if I think you got a pop up. That said, because they waited a few seconds, but I want to see some exit intent, and the thing that I took from my notes is like, this would be a valuable place, whether here or the page before, to have like an online chat.

00:22:46:17 - 00:22:47:17

Steve Cerasoli

Yeah.

00:22:47:18 - 00:23:03:07

Steve Young

To just say like, hey, I don't know what to sign up for, but you can get some details here that you wouldn't normally get. So I would try to have an online chat here because I have an online chat, my website, I don't get that many people commenting, but at the same time the people that have like Steve, this is broken.

00:23:03:10 - 00:23:11:13

Steve Young

Or can you explain this more? And so allows me to kind of use that data, another data point to optimize the funnel.

00:23:11:15 - 00:23:12:10

Steve Cerasoli

Awesome.

00:23:12:12 - 00:23:14:16

Steve Young

Sorry Steve. To fix that.

00:23:14:16 - 00:23:33:04

Steve Cerasoli

Fix that funnel. That's what we're doing today. So we got our last screen here. You know say we put our information in and now we're part of the rebellion. They thank us for joining them. And then they have a couple steps here. You can click here to download the app. The in the app you click I already have an account.

00:23:33:06 - 00:23:42:23

Steve Cerasoli

And then you're in to the actual Assign a rebel app. They got a couple steps here. It seems like there's a little bit of friction here. Is there anything they can be doing differently to make this whole process easier on this last screen?

00:23:43:04 - 00:23:59:08

Steve Young

There you go. So quickly you download the app. Yeah. Video. Right. I do this again. I'm copying a lot of the content creators and course creators. I have a community of my own. When they join, I send them a video and it builds that awareness. And you know, I got so tired of like creating custom videos for everybody.

00:23:59:08 - 00:24:20:19

Steve Young

I just create one video. I was like, welcome to the community. Here's what you can do. Here's the download app. I think even if like I know on the if you're optimizing for mobile, like maybe put a QR code like just make it that freakin simple to get them to get them over. But I think video for retention purposes and like, I don't I never assume that they're going to be happy.

00:24:20:19 - 00:24:36:19

Steve Young

Right? You're on a 14 day trial, so this is your opportunity to make sure they stay on that 14 day trial. It's also your opportunity to also get them to work out. What we found with this is me just thinking about it right now, but we found with another fitness app is if you can get them to when they start the trial.

00:24:36:19 - 00:24:58:04

Steve Young

If you get them to do at least one workout, they're going to stay on a lot longer. So this is your opportunity to be like, hey, we got a workout plan for you to have. Click here, download the app. Like, hey, go check out your workout plan, your customized workout plan in the app, and deep link it into the app too and get them to make sure they workout at least once, which they should be doing the email drip campaign.

00:24:58:04 - 00:25:16:12

Steve Young

So that's what we did. Steve, for a client was in that email drip campaign. Day two. It's a day one would be the let's call it a zero is a day. You download the app and you sign up. Day one would be the one where we say, hey, here are most popular workouts and when we change just that subject line, the content was pretty much the same.

00:25:16:13 - 00:25:33:08

Steve Young

We change the subject line. That's when we 1.8 x to two x the workout start. Like people finishing a workout and using the the FOMO or things like popular. Don't miss out. Those work really well. So that's what I would be doing here. Like check out our most popular app workouts here.

00:25:33:10 - 00:25:38:20

Steve Cerasoli

Amazing. Yeah, the the video idea is cool. I think you're the first person to mention that, on the show, but I think that's like.

00:25:38:20 - 00:25:40:10

Steve Young

Yes, let's go.

00:25:40:12 - 00:25:42:00

Steve Cerasoli

Yeah, that's a super take that.

00:25:42:00 - 00:25:44:14

Steve Young

Nathan. Okay.

00:25:44:16 - 00:26:01:00

Steve Cerasoli

Super interesting. Yeah. That's I think more people should do that. I feel like if I saw a video at the end of a song, a rebel, I'd be like, wow, that was an amazing onboarding flow. Yeah. Cool. Let's talk about some takeaways. So what are some things that they did really, really well here. To start off.

00:26:01:01 - 00:26:18:13

Steve Young

Yeah. Well they had a great onboarding. It was easy right. Seamless. It was easy questions. So they didn't make it too hard for us. And they weren't like offending us in terms of like, oh, I got it. I hate when people like go check your email address and put in this code. So it's frictionless, frictionless. What I would say.

00:26:18:15 - 00:26:22:10

Steve Cerasoli

So Steve, what are some opportunities for growth here for a sauna?

00:26:22:12 - 00:26:46:05

Steve Young

Well, to summarize, Steve, we would say maybe a little bit more social proof throughout the onboarding. Like interject a few screens just to give them a break and then show that you're truly customizing it like a little bit of before and afters or flexibility. And on that payment page, think about incorporating video on like that pricing page and then ultimately post the the trial.

00:26:46:05 - 00:26:54:22

Steve Young

Get them to try to work out at least once. The goal being work out. Do your first workout so that they stay on to a sauna rebel instead of canceling their trial.

00:26:55:00 - 00:27:04:23

Steve Cerasoli

Amazing. As a video guy, I am always about more video. So I know you're a video guy too. So yeah, more videos. Always good. Awesome. Cool. Thanks man, I appreciate it. Steve.
