00:00:00:05 - 00:00:08:17

Steve

Hey, everybody, welcome to fix that funnel. Today I am joined once again by the extremely talented founder of Perceptycs, Nathan Hudson. Nathan, thanks for being here, man, I appreciate it.

00:00:08:18 - 00:00:10:20

Nathan

No, thank you for having me. It's great to be back.

00:00:10:22 - 00:00:17:08

Steve

I know last time, Nathan, you kind of explained your background a little bit. Do you want to do that one more time just for this new episode?

00:00:17:10 - 00:00:38:00

Nathan

It's everyone. I'm Nathan Hudson, founder of skeptics, where we work with mobile apps ranging from new startups to apps generating 10 million year plus revenue. And we do a lot of work with website funnels, building funnels, strategizing funnels, analyzing funnels, a B, testing, tearing down funnels and just helping apps convert profitably on the web.

00:00:38:02 - 00:00:57:14

Steve

And yet today we're going to be talking about My Fitness Pal, which is a bit of these all in one, fitness platforms. They got everything they got dieting regimens, workout plans, calorie counters, and it's all built into kind of one dashboard. How popular is like web two app amongst the fitness space for apps that are similar to MyFitnessPal?

00:00:57:16 - 00:01:15:10

Nathan

So web two app with fitness apps is super popular. Typically fitness apps have the low onboarding journeys in app. They need to ask a whole lot of questions to personalize the experience, and we just see a lot of apps gravitate towards it. But My Fitness Pal is unique in that it's not just a fitness app, it's like a calorie tracking app, right?

00:01:15:10 - 00:01:27:13

Nathan

And it's like a all around health app. I'm a massive fan. It's the one fitness app that I use every day. And in that space there aren't so many apps that are really pushing what app as hard.

00:01:27:15 - 00:01:42:20

Steve

Yeah, it is super interesting. MyFitnessPal is definitely the one that I use as well. I remember back in the day when I was trying to trying to get fit, like a couple of years ago, I've completely fallen off, but at a certain point I was actually using MyFitnessPal for like a couple months straight. It was super, super helpful.

00:01:43:00 - 00:02:00:03

Steve

And now let's talk a little bit about kind of web two app in general and kind of what they're doing here. So they're obviously running this strategy where, you know, you can pay in the App Store, you can pay on the web as well. So we're going to be running through the desktop onboarding just because it's easier for kind of what we're doing here, screen sharing and stuff.

00:02:00:03 - 00:02:06:11

Steve

But it's actually when people are running through a web funnel, it's actually more popular on like a mobile browser, right?

00:02:06:12 - 00:02:34:06

Nathan

That's right. I mean, mobile web is kind of the predominant web platform for most users, especially when they're coming from a social media platform, TikTok meta. That's kind of where people are spending their time. So most of the time people will be going through these onboarding journeys on mobile, web, but desktop, especially for an app like My Fitness Pal, it's going to be relevant to look at because people will ultimately go through and sign up on the web if they're in front of their laptop like we are now.

00:02:34:08 - 00:02:47:03

Nathan

And although funny thing is, I do remember a couple of years ago the MyFitnessPal web app being really bad. So perhaps it's not the case that they have so many users going through web, but I think they have revamped it since then.

00:02:47:05 - 00:03:06:05

Steve

Yeah, on the on the last page. Like I mean, we'll get to it eventually. But they do say like the, the, the web the web experience is only half the experience. Download the mobile app. So so the mobile app definitely. I'm assuming has a lot of benefits to it that the web doesn't. And then, my other question for you is when a company gets as big as my Fitness Pal.

00:03:06:05 - 00:03:21:17

Steve

I know we both said we both use it like it's definitely one of the top, fitness apps in the space right now. Does a web tap strategy become more important? Or like, what are the big companies and a company like of this size have to consider for a smaller company just starting out when it comes to web funnels?

00:03:21:19 - 00:03:43:02

Nathan

Yeah. Well, I mean, one thing that we haven't really discussed before that's worth noting is organic search on mobile web, right? I mean, typically we think about organic search on the App Store or we think about organic search on web. But mobile web specifically, there are going to be a large number of people who look for an app and just search in on Google MyFitnessPal.

00:03:43:04 - 00:04:00:20

Nathan

And when they do that, what comes up? Does My Fitness Pal come up or does something else come up? Of course my fitness comes up, so when they click on the site, what this experience look like is that optimized for mobile web and is it a smooth conversion journey or as smooth as possible? I think that's a really important entry point.

00:04:00:22 - 00:04:19:11

Nathan

There is a lot of opportunity when you are spending that much money on acquisition or have as much, you know, brand equity as my fitness pal, that you're going to have a hideous number of users coming through your website and you want to optimize that experience for conversion. So that is kind of another reason why a web tap strategy would make a lot of sense for them.

00:04:19:13 - 00:04:38:09

Steve

And, yeah. So we're we're definitely touting the benefits of web tap. And it's kind of one of the, the main points this shows to kind of like highlight the space and talk about why it's good, but it's not necessarily like a super easy thing you can create with just a click of a button, right. Like what are some of the challenges that come with setting up a strategy, like with, what My Fitness Pal is doing here?

00:04:38:11 - 00:04:57:05

Nathan

My Fitness Pal, you know, they're big company with a big team, and for them, it's not so difficult to implement. But logistically it is, you know, not the easiest thing to do in that you need to be able to take payments on the web, which most apps wouldn't have even considered before. So therefore, you know, a solution like paddle makes a lot of sense.

00:04:57:11 - 00:05:13:01

Nathan

I'm not sure what my fitness palette are using here. But beyond that, just building out the funnel itself and the journey and the experience, they already had a website, so arguably they could have just, you know, stuck a check out on to that. But I guess we're going to go through in a minute and see what exactly they have done.

00:05:13:03 - 00:05:31:04

Nathan

But if there's anything else beyond that, then they're going to either need a website builder like a tool that's this exists specifically for this purpose or, you know, have a really savvy front end developer, you know, web developer, to help them build this out. So it's it's not easy. It's not like you can just spin it up in seconds.

00:05:31:04 - 00:05:45:09

Nathan

There are some kind of hacky things you can do to get web funnels up super quickly. But for brand of My Fitness Pal size, they're going to be very concerned about ensuring that the quality of the funnel is is up to par and that the brand kind of echoes throughout that.

00:05:45:13 - 00:06:06:23

Steve

All right. Well, let's check out that quality right now by jumping right into their onboarding here. This is interesting. I was going to actually do this on the actual like the web itself and run through it, but I have to do it in the slideshow here because I was running through it so many times this morning that they actually like, they, I get like a bad gateway message now, and I try to log in, so I screenshotted everything, thank God beforehand.

00:06:06:23 - 00:06:26:07

Steve

Now we could just run through it in the slideshow here. So hopefully it I'm able to gather all the same insights as if we were to do on the website. But let's just go for it here, because our first page here that we're hit with. But to actually get to this point, you know, a user has to click on an ad like you were saying or like wander over to the home page somehow, word of mouth or something like that.

00:06:26:07 - 00:06:36:12

Steve

And then we hear a ton about, like the idea of attribution and like attribution benefits that come with the open web. How does the web make like attribution data and like these different user touchpoints easier to determine?

00:06:36:12 - 00:06:58:02

Nathan

I mean, they're quite a few things, right? I mean, pixel tracking is is super common, but, you know, server to server conversion API can really help when it comes to attribution in terms of just making sure that you have accurate conversion data or more accurate conversion data, but specifically one of the things that's quite handy on web, especially when we're looking at server, is the ability to actually keep an aggregated data.

00:06:58:07 - 00:07:17:10

Nathan

So if you are going through the funnel and you're converting and you're signing up, and then you actually do purchase or don't purchase, being able to, you know, retarget those users and identify who they are, especially if you are, you know, not just using like a funnel builder, but have more of a native web app experience can be can be super beneficial.

00:07:17:14 - 00:07:35:17

Nathan

So that's something you just can't do on mobile. You can on web at the moment. Let's see if anything changes in terms of privacy, but that can be a really massive benefit, not just for kind of short term channel attribution, but long term LTV and recognizing which channels are performing better than others.

00:07:35:19 - 00:07:48:20

Steve

And now, to get into the actual onboarding itself, here, we have this first page here, which kind of gives like a summary of my fitness pals values, you know, and shows off kind of the product and what it can do. What are some things that you like to see on, like the first page of an onboarding screen or like this.

00:07:48:22 - 00:08:06:03

Nathan

Yeah. So it's kind of two things I'm looking to understand. One, what am I going to get out of this? What is the big promise that I can take away? And two, what does it do, in that, you know, arguably we could say we all know what MyFitnessPal does potentially, but there will be a percentage of people that don't.

00:08:06:05 - 00:08:30:10

Nathan

And depending on how they landed on this page, let's say if you're an ad creative versus, you know, organic search, they're going to be a different intent and different understanding of the brand. So I am actually I don't know whether or not they have. It would be interesting to check. Actually I see whether they're running any web ads on meta and pushing people to the same or different funnel, but I'm looking for language that kind of tells me what's happening.

00:08:30:10 - 00:08:46:14

Nathan

So, for example, I can see that the middle image is going on about calories and really pushing some numbers there. I think it's it's a little bit small on my screen, but I think I can see that the total, the food, you know, how many calories and burn stuff like that and you can discover the impact of your food.

00:08:46:14 - 00:09:07:12

Nathan

Fitness makes sense. I think what's interesting is that they're not pushing the word calories, right? Like when I think of my fitness part, I think of a calorie tracker or a macronutrient tracker, and that's kind of not what I'm I'm being told that I'm being told, you know, kind of higher level, higher level language. Right? Make mindful eating a habit for life, impact of your food and fitness.

00:09:07:12 - 00:09:08:23

Nathan

So I think that is is interesting.

00:09:09:04 - 00:09:27:00

Steve

And let's just dive in a little deeper here. So we get this page here about goals to kind of start us off. I mean you put your name in here so then they can kind of customize it for you. Thanks, Steve. Now here's your goals. I'm assuming goals are a thing that you see a lot in fitness apps and kind of like, does it make sense to start off with like a goal in mind.

00:09:27:00 - 00:09:27:10

Steve

Yeah.

00:09:27:10 - 00:09:48:02

Nathan

So we do see a lot of this kind of goal language. I think it comes down to a question of why are they doing it. Like what purpose does it serve? I think it's a couple of things. One, for my fitness pals specifically, they're looking to get data and kind of understand what users are looking to do because that can influence the acquisition strategy, stuff like this.

00:09:48:04 - 00:10:05:04

Nathan

But beyond that, they're also looking to make sure they give you the most optimal product experience. And I think that for a lot of people, if if you are coming to an app and you don't really know what it can do, seeing all the things that can do, can one help you understand? Oh, so it can do this or this or this what I'm actually here for?

00:10:05:06 - 00:10:26:00

Nathan

Or it can actually just nudge the app to give you a more tailored experience. So I think the main thing is personalization. As a user of the app, I do know that you can set goals specifically in the app and kind of have have, macros and calories set for you. So I'm guessing that this data is going to be used for that, which is pretty exciting.

00:10:26:00 - 00:10:28:19

Nathan

But I guess we will we will find out.

00:10:28:21 - 00:10:47:23

Steve

All right. Awesome. And then other things interesting here is we get this kind of like call and response. So I know we mentioned it with Blinkist too. Where, you know, you get you give and you kind of get something in return here. So I think they actually do it a little better and highlighted here. So yeah, for in the past we've been using various maintaining weight.

00:10:48:05 - 00:10:57:22

Steve

And then they kind of say like you know we get it. There's a lot of pressure. Follow a diet. Exactly right. And it was similar with Blinkist where they have this kind of like back and forth view. What's the importance of something like that?

00:10:57:22 - 00:11:16:01

Nathan

I think as we kind of just said before, it breaks up the monotony. I don't just want to be doing a quiz and not understanding what this data is for, and not really understanding how it improves my experience. The idea of this is to one keep you hooked in to think that, okay, yeah, this is going somewhere. This isn't what it does.

00:11:16:01 - 00:11:35:05

Nathan

Do that at the end. Right? Versus let's go into the specifics so we can build your personalized plan, reinforcing what you're asking. So many questions. But beyond that, it's also just making the user feel more comfortable and willing to actually participate, which is is something that's pretty important for long onboarding journeys. Specifically because losers can just lose interest.

00:11:35:07 - 00:11:51:02

Steve

And then if we go through here a little bit more, so we get baseline activity level kind of answer there can create a username. Then we're kind of done with the flow. Is there anything that kind of sticks out about their onboarding flow to you or anything that that you think they could experiment with going forward?

00:11:51:07 - 00:12:11:01

Nathan

So I think and this could just be because it's the best of experience. But there are an awful lot of questions, a straight answers for each question. And it can kind of lead users to a point of choice paralysis. What have I what have been my barriers? All of them. Right. Let's just collect them all. So maybe they're doing this because it's a select all question.

00:12:11:01 - 00:12:35:03

Nathan

But I think also for the next question, it kind of gets to the point where you're thinking, what answer should I pick. So I think maybe they could experiment with not having so many or having like a custom field would be interesting to see if people, people opt for that. But the main reason I say this is just because on mobile, the amount of screen real estate you have to actually scroll through or select, maybe, maybe changing.

00:12:35:05 - 00:12:44:01

Steve

And then our last screen here, we have this kind of congratulations. And it kind of sets your calorie goal. Why is this a screen a good screen to end on here.

00:12:44:01 - 00:13:02:11

Nathan

Yeah I think for my fitness power specifically I think this is really interesting. And I'm going to start with the part that kind of confuses me because I think it's it's worth just touching on, which is all of a sudden now everything becomes about calories, right? Like if you remember when we looked at the kind of initial screen, it didn't really mention calories at all.

00:13:02:11 - 00:13:19:20

Nathan

It was kind of quite mindful, high level language. And now all of a sudden it's talking about calories. So I think it almost feels like there's a slight disconnect there, which would be interesting to to see some data behind. And but beyond that, as someone who's a user of the app, I completely get why this is the screen that we're ending on.

00:13:19:22 - 00:13:39:05

Nathan

It's kind of telling me, okay, this is what you need to eat. This is your goal. If you do this, you should maintain your current weight. And I think that's exactly what you came for. Right when you were filling in this onboarding survey, you were trying to actually select information, input information that is relevant so that you could get something to maintain your weight.

00:13:39:10 - 00:14:00:14

Nathan

And now you've got your answer. So without even having to do too much or, you know, pay anything, you know now exactly what you need to do to maintain your weight. And I think that's actually quite clever because we talk a lot about providing value upfront and leading with value and always being about value value, value, value. But in practice, what does that look like?

00:14:00:16 - 00:14:19:13

Nathan

And I think this is arguably an example of that. It's a case of we're going to tell you exactly what you need to do, and you don't have to give us really anything other than a few moments of your time and some answers. The question then becomes, how do I do that? And that's when the Explore my Fitness power button kind of takes the forefront.

00:14:19:15 - 00:14:38:21

Steve

Yeah. And then it leads you right into to this page here. So you have access to your dashboard. But before you fully have access you have this pop up here where it actually tries to convert you over to start a free trial of premium. So this screens obviously at the end here, I've noticed that the screen kind of pops up in different places.

00:14:38:21 - 00:14:47:16

Steve

Is there like is there a reason why you would end your survey with, trying to convert some of the premium versus like putting it somewhere earlier, earlier in the actual onboarding process?

00:14:47:18 - 00:15:09:23

Nathan

Yeah. So I think context is key. Like midway through onboarding, I didn't really know what I was signing up for. I didn't know what the product really did. I didn't know how many calories I needed to eat. I didn't really know how difficult that was. I didn't really have that question of, so how do I do that? That came when they told me, you need to eat ten, 20, ten calories to maintain your weight.

00:15:09:23 - 00:15:28:20

Nathan

At that point, I understood. Okay, cool. But now I feel overwhelmed. How do I do that? So right off to that point does make a lot of sense. And I think also you're building up users to be able to commit to actually paying, right? I like to talk of web onboarding journeys, priming users to pay. I think that's exactly what they're doing.

00:15:29:02 - 00:15:47:07

Nathan

They're asking us these questions. They kind of getting a feel of what it is we're looking for. And then once they deliver that value, then they ask us to pay. So I wouldn't put this any earlier. I actually think they could be a little bit more overt in terms of not just having, you know, start my free trial with kind of vague, well, maybe we will click it.

00:15:47:09 - 00:15:51:11

Nathan

So let me, let me not go too far yet. Let's, let's see where they take us next.

00:15:51:12 - 00:16:07:13

Steve

So actually if you were to ignore it, you'd get hit with this page here, which is just the kind of the dashboard where they blur out your actual metrics here. I guess you could call them. I thought this was kind of an interesting strategy to kind of, like, tease you by withholding this value. Is this like a common strategy, you see?

00:16:07:13 - 00:16:09:07

Steve

And is this like, is this super effective?

00:16:09:07 - 00:16:41:15

Nathan

Yeah. I mean we see a lot of dating apps, right? So dating apps will blur certain profiles and then kind of lock these behind a paywall or kind of give you limited amount of access. So essentially that freemium experience, I will make a confession which I shared before on LinkedIn. But but let's share it here. Everyone, which is I've use my fitness every day for the past seven years, and I am not a premium user, and I don't need to be because I can get all the value I need out of the free products, and I definitely have how we use it.

00:16:41:15 - 00:16:56:15

Nathan

So potentially they're missing out on revenue by not. But I think it just does go to show that you can hook people in to want new content, even if they're not me. And I think that's what they're essentially doing here, not with content, but with functionality.

00:16:56:17 - 00:17:00:20

Steve

Yeah. What would it take to get you to become a premium user, do you think?

00:17:00:22 - 00:17:19:18

Nathan

I think it's tricky and I think I think it's worth it's worth this touch on it. So for me personally, I have been tracking macros for a while. So I understand the importance of, you know, the macro section. Now on the mobile app you can see macros for foods you just can't see, you know, nice aggregated charts and data as much.

00:17:19:21 - 00:17:38:16

Nathan

I don't need to see that. I just need to know is this food going to help me hit this number? If so, great. If not, I need to change some things. So for me, I don't think there's anything they could actually do. To get me to be a premium user other than lock every single macro metric possible, and then I probably would pay or find another solution.

00:17:38:18 - 00:17:58:12

Nathan

But I think what that goes to show is who they're aiming things for, because when I first got my fitness power, I was the most tempted to just pay because I was overwhelmed. I did want to make sure I had everything I needed to actually hit that goal. And I think this is the thing to touch on, which is they've said, this is what you need to do to get your go kind of created.

00:17:58:12 - 00:18:14:04

Nathan

That sense of, but I don't know how. And then giving you a product and then locked everything. So now you really don't know how and you feel like, oh, so I need to go premium in order to use this product because that's what this page kind of says. It says you can't do anything unless you pay. You can.

00:18:14:06 - 00:18:17:07

Nathan

But that's what the UI is suggesting.

00:18:17:12 - 00:18:36:02

Steve

So if you were to hit one of these yellow go premium buttons or this start free trial button, you'd get hit with this paywall here. So we got this kind of simple page, you know, the Guardian Cash app. They offer Google Pay and then they also localized pricing. I know we touched upon this when we did Blinkist, but it's kind of paddles bread and butter.

00:18:36:02 - 00:18:43:22

Steve

Here is the paywall page. So would we be able to just hammer home the importance of localized pricing one more time for MyFitnessPal?

00:18:44:03 - 00:19:06:04

Nathan

Absolutely. I mean, I I'm trying to think have I ever been on a check out where I saw pricing that wasn't localized and then purchased? And I think the only like maybe once or twice in my life. But whenever that happens, you immediately feel skeptical and kind of lose trust, like you're like, is this safe? Even if you're in the UK and it's USD, right?

00:19:06:04 - 00:19:22:19

Nathan

You're like, is this safe? I don't know, so there's that aspect. And then especially now, if you're, you know, if you're in if I'm in Europe and I'm seeing a currency that is like not in the West, if I currency I don't recognize, I like, I don't know what this is. So that's a that's an issue. But I don't think that's what most people are going to face.

00:19:22:19 - 00:19:40:05

Nathan

I think really it comes down to recognizing how much am I actually going to be charged for this product, and what does that mean? I don't know what 4999 looks like in USD. I mean, I do, but hypothetically, you know, a lot of people may not know what 4999 equates to USD to E or EU or to GPP.

00:19:40:06 - 00:19:45:06

Nathan

So I think that's important in terms of conversion. It's it's a must have.

00:19:45:08 - 00:20:01:19

Steve

And then yeah, same goes for the different payment options too. Like what is the importance of offering something like Cash App and Google Pay alongside a credit card. Because we've seen some companies this season that, you know, card only. Is it important to offer a diverse set of payment options?

00:20:01:22 - 00:20:18:02

Nathan

Yeah, I think this this one is more nuanced, right? Not more nuanced, but at least more interesting to kind of touch on because we assume that price is going to be localized, but we don't assume that every site we go to is going to have every payment option possible. I think it's interesting. It's easy to say the more the merrier, right?

00:20:18:02 - 00:20:44:00

Nathan

Just add everything card, Cash app, Google Pay, Apple Pay everything, pay PayPal. And I think maybe, maybe that is the route. I think if you hadn't, you know, other options button, that would be great. I think there's no reason not to have that. It gives people more flexibility. People have their different preferred methods of payment and but I think experimentation does need to be done in order to figure out which payment options to have centrally.

00:20:44:06 - 00:21:02:11

Nathan

For example, Cash App Pay is very dominant on this page, right? PayPal is not on this page. I'm not sure if there's a reason for that. Potentially it's the fees. I'm not sure, but I do think it comes down to understanding one who is actually going to be buying. So who the audience. And then, you know, giving those those options.

00:21:02:11 - 00:21:25:10

Nathan

And that comes not through the journey that we've gone through, but them having a good understanding of who the buyers are or the one thing that we could say which would be quite interesting is it would be cool if they could kind of get data around age and location and figure out all their trends in terms of what payment methods specific people like to use.

00:21:25:12 - 00:21:41:14

Nathan

And the reason I say that is because from clients we've worked with and experiments, we've run them, we've seen that, you know, Apple Pay, Google Pay as fast as possible is what you want to use when you're working with younger audiences. You know, any any at 25 plus, it's like make it as smooth and fast as possible.

00:21:41:14 - 00:22:00:14

Nathan

They'll probably just double click and go for it. Whereas when we've ran, you know, campaigns and worked with apps and clients have had older audiences. So we're saying 45, 55, even 60 plus. We've seen a lot of them favor card details and entering card, whether it's because it's it's safer or just because they're more comfortable and familiar with that.

00:22:00:16 - 00:22:05:05

Nathan

I think it does matter depending on demographic information.

00:22:05:07 - 00:22:23:10

Steve

Yeah, that's super interesting. I never thought about that angle. But yeah, it's true. If we want to jump into the last section here before we let you go to your webinar. So this is just the last page where hit with you. If you find it hard to see here. But you know, just congrats, let's crush some goals. And then you know you can explore premium.

00:22:23:10 - 00:22:37:07

Steve

You get a small text. You're saying website offerings are limited, which I think I touched on before. And then you get two buttons here to download on the App Store or Google Play. So this like final screen, we see a lot of variation here. Like, you know, sometimes you see a QR code, sometimes you see nothing at all.

00:22:37:07 - 00:22:52:18

Steve

You might just get an email and then sometimes you get these buttons here with kind of the Apple logo and Google Google logo there. Do you have a preference for this or is like is is it kind of just a mishmash of like, you know, try, try one out and see if it works or like what's the best method to get people to your app?

00:22:52:20 - 00:23:15:17

Nathan

I think you have to kind of break it down. Where am I and where do I need to go? I'm on desktop web and I need to get a mobile app on my phone. Having the Apple Store and Google Play buttons there don't really make sense as icons. I make sense because I now know where to go, but chances are I know where to go anyway and they're a little bit more central.

00:23:15:23 - 00:23:36:07

Nathan

So I think a QR code would be more interesting in this case in terms of the safest option, I think having that email line that's at the bottom way, more prevalent at the top of the screen and dominant in terms of like a heading structure, maybe like a H2 would be better because that's what matters regardless of what device I'm on.

00:23:36:07 - 00:24:00:14

Nathan

I know you emailed me. Fine. I could just go there. I don't just get anything. I don't have to click anything. I'll just get my phone out and go to my email. I think them they might be missing something that again, maybe they've tested that and it didn't work out. But for anyone watching who's looking to try and really optimize the experience from web to app in that that linking process, I would 100% say have a QR code only if they're on desktop.

00:24:00:16 - 00:24:09:17

Nathan

Make sure whatever platform they're on that it's clear that you email them and have that in large, large copy. I think that's what's missing from this page.

00:24:09:19 - 00:24:23:14

Steve

Awesome, man. Cool. Well, that that concludes the actual web funnel there. And, let's just end with a couple takeaways. So what are two things that my fitness pals doing really well that like another company watching could take from them?

00:24:23:16 - 00:24:46:04

Nathan

I don't think they're actually optimizing for the web journey. And because I think I think from what we've seen, they left a lot of things on the table and left a lot of stones unturned that I think, why wouldn't you do that either? It's because they are so in tune with their data that they know certain things are working for them that just aren't best practice, in which case they're crushing it in terms of doing what works best on data.

00:24:46:08 - 00:25:09:03

Nathan

But if that's not the case, I think there's a lot of opportunity. But that being said, I think there are obviously some things that they've done really well. I think not just having a consistent thread of questions in like a survey type approach and breaking that up with some interstitials and information can be super helpful. And I think the most amazing thing that they've done, which hats off for, is that.

00:25:09:05 - 00:25:24:05

Nathan

But what do I do now? Moment when you see that you need to eat a certain number of calories? How do I do that? Like you just giving me a number. I think that kind of I think that question that arises up in that kind of friction point of I can't do this is what's going to help convert people.

00:25:24:05 - 00:25:25:18

Nathan

So that's great.

00:25:25:19 - 00:25:35:10

Steve

Awesome. And then, yeah. So you kind of touched on it in the beginning, but what are some opportunities for, for growth here or something that they could experiment with going into 2025?

00:25:35:12 - 00:26:04:04

Nathan

Yeah, I think the UI itself could be a little bit smoother. You know, it feels a little bit outdated. Still, I think that's that's one area. I think the funnel itself is still a little bit just information for information sake in terms of question. Question. Yes. Like I said, it's great they break it up. But I think the questions they're asking could go a little bit deeper and kind of be a bit more nuanced, instead of just asking me about my goal, maybe also, why do I want that goal?

00:26:04:04 - 00:26:22:18

Nathan

Is there a specific timeline I have in mind? What am I looking to do to really get me invested? Because going through that funnel with you, I didn't feel invested as a user. I felt like, yeah, this is a quiz which all apps have before I can actually do anything, but I feel like there's an opportunity to really hook people in.

00:26:22:20 - 00:26:35:01

Steve

Nathan, thank you so much, Matt. I appreciate you, jumping on with us again. The first, returning, returning guest to fix that funnel. Appreciate it. And. Yeah, yeah, have fun at the, have fun at the webinar today.

00:26:35:03 - 00:26:39:00

Nathan

No. Thank you. It should be good fun. And as always, let's fix some more funnels.
