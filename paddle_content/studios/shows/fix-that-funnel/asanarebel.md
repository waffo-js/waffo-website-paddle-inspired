Welcome to another episode of _Fix That Funnel_. Today, we're breaking down the **web funnel of Asana Rebel** , one of the biggest apps in the fitness and wellness space. With yoga lessons for both beginners and vets alike, it's a great app if you want to get in shape or just destress from your busy life.

But how flexible is their web2app strategy? To find out, we're enlisting the help of [**Steve P. Young**](linkedin.com/in/stevepyoung), founder of [Appmasters.com](https://appmasters.com/), to explore what’s working—and what could use some improvements.

Still want more? Check out the [**full interview with Steve Young**](/shows/fix-that-funnel/asana-rebel-uncut), exclusively available on Paddle Studios.

## Web2App Strategy

Asana Rebel supports both App Store and web purchases, here's why that hybrid approach is so powerful for apps in the wellness category:

  * **Higher Willingness to Pay on Web** : Web users are more likely to convert at premium price points and tend to retain longer than app-only subscribers.
  * **Revenue Advantage** : Avoiding Apple’s 15–30% cut and only paying a ~2% fee through platforms like Paddle gives brands more revenue to reinvest.
  * **Wider Audience Access** : Web-to-app campaigns unlock new, often under-targeted segments — including high-paying Android users.
  * **Ad Flexibility** : Meta, Google, and Link-in-bio campaigns all lead well into web funnels. Sending traffic straight to the app? Less effective, higher drop-off.


## Onboarding

Asana Rebel’s onboarding starts with a full-screen landing page designed for **mobile-first** engagement — not surprising, given most traffic arrives via phones. We're breaking down why this works:

  * **Mobile Behavior Dominates** : Even for web campaigns, users are mostly browsing on mobile. Designing with that in mind is critical.
  * **Ad Channels Shape the Experience** : Meta and Google Ads work better when paired with direct, campaign-specific landers — not generic homepages.
  * **Starts with Simple Questions** : Gender is the first question — easy, non-invasive, and a quick win for user momentum.

![Gender Question](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/aF66Pnfc4bHWiy6n_FTF-Sxx-Exx-Template-v1.00_05_55_01.Still003.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

  * **Goal-Based Language** : Like other fitness apps, Asana Rebel asks users to define their goals (e.g., lose weight, get toned). Different goals lead to different trial conversion rates — a valuable personalization and targeting tool.

![Conversion Rates](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/aF66P3fc4bHWiy6p_FTF-Sxx-Exx-Template-v1.00_06_28_05.Still004.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

  * **Progressive Personalization** : As the flow continues, questions get more personal. This is by design — you want to build trust before asking sensitive or reflective questions. There is also the element of price discrimination, where customers can be charged less or more based on their responses within the flow.
  * **Social Proof Appears Late** : Testimonials and trust signals only appear toward the end of the funnel. Ideally, they should be woven throughout.
  * **Loading Screen Psychology** : The final step before the paywall is a “customizing your experience” screen with a loading bar — a subtle psychological tactic that we've seen boost conversions by ~10–11% in past tests.

![Loading Bar](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/aF66QXfc4bHWiy6r_FTF-Sxx-Exx-Template-v1.00_07_43_11.Still006.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

Overall, Asana Rebel’s onboarding is clean, mobile-optimized, and goal-driven — a great match for its fitness-first brand positioning.

## Paywall

After onboarding, users hit the paywall. The structure is solid, but there are a few areas for improvement:

  * **Localized Pricing** : The paywall dynamically adjusts currency based on location (USD in the U.S., Euros in Europe, etc.). This increases trust and reduces cognitive friction.
  * **Purchasing Power Sensitivity** : Not all $35.99s are equal. Brands should test regional price adaptations — sometimes cutting prices by 50–90% in lower-income markets — and adjust based on actual LTV and CAC.

![Asana Rebel Data](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/aF66Qnfc4bHWiy6s_FTF-Sxx-Exx-Template-v1.00_08_09_06.Still007.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

  * **Payment Options** : Currently, the page supports credit cards and PayPal. While this covers a good chunk of users, options like Apple Pay or Google Pay could reduce checkout friction even further.

![Payment Methods](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/aF66Q3fc4bHWiy6t_FTF-Sxx-Exx-Template-v1.00_08_44_06.Still008.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

  * **Exit Intent Opportunities** : Adding live chat, more testimonials, or a “don’t go” offer for hesitating users could rescue conversions.
  * **Missing: Post-Onboarding Personalization** : At this point in the journey, users have already told Asana Rebel their fitness goals — but that data isn’t clearly reflected in the paywall copy or offer framing.


We adding more value-forward language and personalized framing to increase emotional buy-in.

## Download Friction

After the purchase, users are shown a basic app download screen — but this moment could be much more powerful.

  * **Use Video** : A welcome video from the founder or coach builds emotional connection. Steve uses this tactic in his own community onboarding.

![Steve Video](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/aF66RXfc4bHWiy6v_FTF-Sxx-Exx-Template-v1.00_09_45_02.Still010.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

  * **QR Code (Especially for Desktop)** : For users who sign up on a computer, make it easy to grab their phone and scan a code.
  * **In-App Plan Hook** : Don’t just say “download the app.” Say “your personalized workout plan is waiting inside” — drive urgency and make the app feel immediately valuable.


The post-purchase experience is one of the most overlooked parts of a web funnel — but it’s also one of the most crucial for app retention.

## 🧠 Wrap-Up

**What Asana Rebel Does Well:**

  1. **Smooth Onboarding Flow** : The funnel starts with easy questions and keeps users moving without overwhelming them. There’s no friction, no unnecessary steps — just focused progression.
  2. **Solid Pricing and Localization** : The dynamic pricing model adapts to user location, and the design keeps things conversion-focused without being pushy.


**Where It Can Improve:**

  1. **Stronger Use of Social Proof** : Sprinkling testimonials or trust signals earlier and throughout onboarding could ease skepticism before the paywall.
  2. **Deeper Personalization Post-Trial** : Using a user’s goals to tailor messaging in the paywall and post-signup app flow could create a tighter loop between data input and perceived value.

Next week, _Fix That Funnel_ decides to go on a health kick with [Noom.](https://www.noom.com/)

00:00:04:13 - 00:00:28:03

Steve Cerasoli

Oh hi there. Now it gets stressful having to deal with all the trends in the app growth space between keeping up with weekly web two app news and evangelizing people all over the world about fix that funnel. I need some peace and quiet to balance out the constant noise. That's where I turn to asana. Rebel, an app that makes yoga easy, and it helps me breathe in and breathe out.

00:00:28:05 - 00:00:50:06

Steve Cerasoli

Now, after this session, I'm getting back to my hectic lifestyle. Getting a guest expert on the phone and breaking down asana Rebel's Web two app strategy so you can get steered in the right direction. So are you ready to fix that funnel? We're going to fix that funnel tonight. We're going to fix your funnel, right? We're gonna fix that funnel tonight.

00:00:50:06 - 00:01:02:01

Steve Cerasoli

We're gonna make those prospects buy. Doesn't matter if you're big or small. We're gonna fix your onboarding. And meanwhile, we're gonna fix that funnel tonight. We're gonna fix.

00:01:02:01 - 00:01:08:19

Steve Cerasoli

That until no.

00:01:08:21 - 00:01:32:21

Steve Cerasoli

The world needs more. World needs more. The world needs. Oh, hello. My name is Steven Webb of the Paddle Phonics. I have a solo career now, and you could be the first to own my solo career on a ten disc set. Paddle presents Steven Webb's The Music of the Paddle Phonics, a ten disc set with all your favorite hits.

00:01:32:23 - 00:01:55:15

Steve Cerasoli

When your product is life, then your prospects are right. That's more great. I know the app stores got an answer, but it's not the only place where customers go web to have those ten discs with all the old classics, as well as new favorites.

00:01:55:17 - 00:02:05:17

Steve Cerasoli

Can you text me higher? To a place where that feels free.

00:02:05:19 - 00:02:12:20

Steve Cerasoli

So what are you waiting for? You love the music you love more by my ten disc set.

00:02:12:22 - 00:02:20:11

Steve Cerasoli

The world needs more.

00:02:20:13 - 00:02:32:00

Steve Cerasoli

Thank you. Thank you very much. Hey, everybody. Welcome to fix that funnel. Today I am joined by the app master himself from App masters.com. It's Steve Young. Steve, thanks for being here Steve.

00:02:32:05 - 00:02:34:02

Steve Young

Thanks for having me again. I'm super excited.

00:02:34:03 - 00:02:37:00

Steve Cerasoli

So Steve, what got you in this crazy world of app growth?

00:02:37:02 - 00:02:54:13

Steve Young

Yeah my son, he was only 18 months at the time. He was using the iPad and he's just learning. I was like, oh my God, this is really working for him. And so that inspired me to try to create more kids apps. But in 2013, I was like, why is there a podcast just about apps? So I started the podcast to interview some of my heroes in this space.

00:02:54:13 - 00:03:07:08

Steve Young

And so now we have a team of 30 and close to 30 people and we specialize in it. So it's a monetization. This is why I'm here. That's how the journey started, just by hitting record with the silly microphone.

00:03:07:08 - 00:03:16:11

Steve Cerasoli

With that being said, let's take a big step back and check out their web app strategy as a whole.

00:03:16:13 - 00:03:23:19

Steve Cerasoli

Now asana Rebel, you can buy it on the web and also buy on the App Store. What's the importance of running a hybrid strategy like this one?

00:03:23:19 - 00:03:39:22

Steve Young

The web users are willing to pay a higher price. The other thing is retention is higher. From the stats I've read, like retention is a lot higher on the web versus the app side of things too. And lastly, come on Steve, we get more money. We don't got to pay the 15 to 30% to Apple anymore. We just have to pay the 2% to paddle.

00:03:40:01 - 00:04:00:18

Steve Young

And the last thing is it opens up your audience even broader. The web two app campaigns brought in the amount of users, and the cool thing that I've seen from my clients is we get Android users. Steve, it's hard to get Android users to pay, but with the web two app campaign, that's where you find your Android users, your high paying Android users as well.

00:04:00:20 - 00:04:11:02

Steve Cerasoli

And last up as we're filming this, there was big news. Just announced that Apple is allowing external payments on the App Store. Now this is huge. What does this mean for the space as a whole?

00:04:11:04 - 00:04:29:11

Steve Young

Let's just say I'm intrigued, right? What if we can give a discount, you know, save 15% and then we're still making more money? I still feel like the App Store makes it a lot easier for us to check out. So I think the conversion rates are a lot higher, giving them incentive to check out on the web. That might be easier.

00:04:29:14 - 00:04:33:12

Steve Young

So there's some benefits here, and I'm curious to see how developers are using it.

00:04:33:12 - 00:04:41:05

Steve Cerasoli

But now that we've seen their web two app strategy as a whole, let's check out their onboarding.

00:04:41:07 - 00:04:47:10

Steve Cerasoli

Now we start off on this landing page here. Now I just google dishonorable. But how would someone actually stumble across this page?

00:04:47:12 - 00:05:03:07

Steve Young

I mean Google ads you can do I mean honestly, you can have a link in bio type of thing and then meta ads is how normal people are using it. We tested Google ads where we just took them to our homepage. We saw like no sales, and we spent a good amount of money like 2 or $3000 on that campaign.

00:05:03:12 - 00:05:15:12

Steve Young

And so I rather send them to a page like this, take them to this journey, and I know it's fitness apps. You're going to have long onboarding. Fitness apps generally do better from a conversion perspective by having longer onboarding.

00:05:15:14 - 00:05:19:22

Steve Cerasoli

Now, one thing I noticed is their onboarding page looks a little mobile. Is that intentional?

00:05:20:00 - 00:05:36:17

Steve Young

It's crazy because even when we've run these campaigns, we see a lot more traction on mobile than we do on the web, too. Most people are, you know, it's not like we're targeting mobile users anyways, so most people are probably on their phones googling stuff versus being on their desktop, like you and I.

00:05:36:19 - 00:05:45:14

Steve Cerasoli

Now, we've obviously seen a ton of first pages this season. What's the importance of leading with this gender question here? Is this for attribution or is this actually going into the personalization?

00:05:45:18 - 00:06:02:19

Steve Young

I like to think about this. Onboarding is like what's the easiest question I can ask without like offending anybody. So it's kind of like, you know, male, female, non-binary, cool. You know, I'm not asking for your email address. I'm not asking for your name. I'm asking for just simple questions. I like this again. This is branded. We can do this through a branded search.

00:06:03:00 - 00:06:05:23

Steve Young

But I think if they're doing cold, you might get a different experience.

00:06:05:23 - 00:06:13:14

Steve Cerasoli

Now we're seeing a lot of goal based language here. We saw the same thing with My Fitness Pal. What's the importance of goal based language for an app like Asana Rebel.

00:06:13:15 - 00:06:33:10

Steve Young

When they selected? I'm just going to lose weight. What we found is sometimes what they pick affects their conversion rate. And so what you can use is that data point to then be like, hey, lose weight and get a tight and fit toned body, right? And then you know that that's what the audience is looking for. I mean, I'm fine with the pick three, but I don't know if they get enough data.

00:06:33:10 - 00:06:43:23

Steve Young

Maybe there's too many combinations, but another client, it was a meditation client, but they saw that, you know, when you selected anxiety relief versus sleep better, that had the highest trial activation rate.

00:06:43:23 - 00:06:53:08

Steve Cerasoli

As we keep going through the onboarding flow, we noticed the questions get a little more personal. So why don't we start off kind of simple and then move more towards personal as we go along.

00:06:53:10 - 00:07:11:16

Steve Young

Asking for simple questions that we could just soft toss? Right now we're like, okay, I think this one is more of like an indication of price discrimination. It's going to be a thing in the future. Now, especially now that we can take users outside of the App Store, because if I'm happy with my body image, I might have to show a lower price.

00:07:11:18 - 00:07:17:10

Steve Cerasoli

And then towards the end here, we're finally seeing some social proof. What's the importance of social proofing and onboarding flow?

00:07:17:12 - 00:07:24:09

Steve Young

I think I like to have social proof everywhere, really. Like I like to intermix them, but definitely before you're going to hit them with the payment.

00:07:24:09 - 00:07:30:17

Steve Cerasoli

And now we're seeing that all too familiar loading bar. What's the importance of this loading bar as this kind of last step here?

00:07:30:19 - 00:07:46:08

Steve Young

That's really to like give them a break and have that social proof and to make users feel like you are actually customizing it. I have data on this, Steve, where I think it was a slight like 10 to 11% increase with the loading screen too. So it's beneficial to to have.

00:07:46:08 - 00:07:53:09

Steve Cerasoli

Now that we've wrapped up our onboarding, it's time to pull out our credit cards and head over to the paywall.

00:07:53:11 - 00:08:08:12

Steve Cerasoli

So we agree the price point looks good and we get to our actual paywall here. When we ran this page through a VPN, we saw they offered true localized pricing. If we're in Europe, I'm seeing euros. If we're in America, I'm seeing USD. Our data also showed that most people were able to buy a sign a rebel in their native currency.

00:08:08:14 - 00:08:11:20

Steve Cerasoli

So, Steve, how important is localized pricing when converting a customer?

00:08:11:22 - 00:08:35:06

Steve Young

Purchasing power is completely different off of different countries. If you are in India, should be 10% of us should be 50% should be 25%. We don't know. And it's just been testing. But what we found in our studies is, you know, when we play around with the pricing and we localize pricing and we make it lower. So when you want to see the currency that you're used to paying in, secondly, 3599 is completely in the US.

00:08:35:08 - 00:08:39:13

Steve Young

It's completely different than 3599 in India. As an example.

00:08:39:17 - 00:08:45:23

Steve Cerasoli

Now let's talk about payment methods. Are they offering enough payment methods here they get credit card and PayPal. Is that enough?

00:08:46:01 - 00:09:04:09

Steve Young

Yeah I think you definitely experiment with like maybe even Apple Pay. I think the other thing that I would like to see on this page, that works really well, it's still more social proof testimonials, something that says, hey, there are others just like you that have seen results. I think you got a pop up that said because they waited a few seconds, but I want to see some exit content in the thing that I took from my notes.

00:09:04:09 - 00:09:19:21

Steve Young

Like this would be a valuable place to have, like an online chat. Because I have an online chat, my website, I don't get that many people commenting, but at the same time, the people that have like Steve, this is broken. Or can you explain this more? And so allows me to kind of use that data. Another data point.

00:09:20:01 - 00:09:28:13

Steve Cerasoli

Now that we've actually bought a sign a rebel, it's time to head from the web over to the app.

00:09:28:15 - 00:09:40:08

Steve Cerasoli

So we have this last screen here, and you can do a ton of things to try to get people from the web over to the app, whether it's QR codes, email, magic links, what do you see here and what's the importance of this last step?

00:09:40:10 - 00:09:57:20

Steve Young

Video? Right, I have a community of my own. When they join, I send them a video and it builds that awareness. And you know, I got so tired of like creating custom videos for everybody. I just create one video. I was like, welcome to community. Here's what you can do. Here's the download app. They're optimizing for mobile. Like maybe put a QR code like just make it that freakin simple.

00:09:57:23 - 00:10:13:18

Steve Young

We found with another fitness app is if you get them to do at least one workout, they're going to stay on a lot longer. So this is your opportunity to be like, hey, we got a workout plan for you. Instead of click here, download the app. Hey, go check out your workout plan, your customized workout plan in the app.

00:10:13:23 - 00:10:17:22

Steve Cerasoli

All right. To wrap it up, Steve, two things. They're doing really, really well here.

00:10:17:22 - 00:10:32:05

Steve Young

They had a great onboarding. It was easy right. Seamless. It was easy questions. So they didn't make it too hard for us. And they weren't like offending us in terms of like oh I got it. I hate when people like go check your email address and put in this code. So it's frictionless.

00:10:32:07 - 00:10:38:11

Steve Cerasoli

And we love Asana rebel. They're doing really, really well. But what are two things you'd like to see improved to make this even better?

00:10:38:12 - 00:10:58:20

Steve Young

Maybe a little bit more social proof throughout the onboarding? Like interject a few screens just to give them a break. And on that payment page, think about incorporating video on like that pricing page, and then ultimately post the trial. It's the goal being workout. Do your first workout so that they stay on to us on a rebel instead of canceling their trial.

00:10:58:22 - 00:11:10:07

Steve Cerasoli

All right, that about does it. I want to thank Steve Young for being here. Make sure to check out Steve Young over on@masters.com. Make sure to check him out on LinkedIn. Make sure to check out Steve Young everywhere you can. Steve thanks for being here.

00:11:10:09 - 00:11:11:13

Steve Young

Absolutely.

00:11:11:15 - 00:11:30:12

Steve Cerasoli

Now that we've wrapped up, I think I need to head back to the dojo and take a load off. I want to thank a Sana rebel. I want to thank Steve Young. And I want to thank you at home for watching. Fix that fumble. Make sure you check us out next week when we break down. Noom. Thanks.
