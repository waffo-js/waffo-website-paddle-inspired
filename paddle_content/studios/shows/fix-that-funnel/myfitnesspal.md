# Does MyFitnessPal Have a Healthy Web Funnel?

On Today's Fix That Funnel, we're joined once again by Nathan Hudson of Perceptycs to break down the fitness powerhouse MyFitnessPal. Is their Web2App hitting their macros or are they coming up short on their goals? We're breaking it all down for you!

  * Notes
  * Transcription


Welcome to another episode of _Fix That Funnel_. Today, we're breaking down the **web funnel of MyFitnessPal** , one of the most widely used apps in the fitness tracking space. With its ability to track everything from meals to workouts, MyFitnessPal is a go-to app for anyone looking to get shredded, stay fit, or just become more mindful of their health habits.

But how strong is their web funnel? Is it as optimized as their macros dashboard? To find out, we're enlisting the help of **Nathan Hudson** , founder of Perceptycs and renowned funnel strategist, to explore what’s working—and what could use a few reps.

Still want more? Check out the [**full interview with Nathan Hudson**](https://www.paddle.com/studios/shows/fix-that-funnel/nathan-hudson-2), exclusively available on Paddle Studios.

## Web2App Strategy

While many users discover MyFitnessPal through mobile ads (on TikTok, Meta, etc.), they often begin their journey on **mobile web** —not the app. But why is this common and why does it matter?:

  * **Mobile Web Is the New Front Door** : It’s where most users first engage, especially through ad platforms.
  * **Desktop Still Plays a Role** : Especially for productivity-focused users who sign up while at their desks.
  * **Scalability for Big Brands** : For a company like MyFitnessPal, with a large team and resources, it’s easier to invest in high-quality web funnels that match the strength of the mobile experience.
  * **Technical Complexity** : Managing payments, maintaining brand quality, and building responsive UI for multiple devices all require advanced setup—something large apps like MyFitnessPal can handle.


Implementing web payments and funnel architecture is non-trivial. That’s why having infrastructure like Paddle makes sense—it handles payment compliance, taxes, and global scale for large apps.

## Onboarding

Once users click through from an ad or land on the MyFitnessPal site, they’re greeted with a modern, goal-based onboarding flow.

![Initial Message](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/aCNomCdWJ-7kSCA1_FTF-Sxx-Exx-Template-v1.00_04_03_00.Still004.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

  * **Initial Messaging** : The onboarding page leads with **value-focused messaging** —less about “calories,” more about transformation and lifestyle goals.
  * **Goal-Based Prompts** : Users are asked what they want to achieve (e.g., weight loss, maintenance), which is both a personalization tactic and a way to align product features with user intent.
  * **Interstitials and Breaks** : The flow includes **non-question moments** , breaking up the quiz-like feel with motivational or informative screens. This reduces friction and keeps users emotionally engaged.
  * **Choice Paralysis** : Some questions have too many response options, which could be overwhelming—especially on smaller mobile screens. He suggests reducing options or adding a custom “Other” field.

![Choice Paralysis](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/aCNonydWJ-7kSCA7_FTF-Sxx-Exx-Template-v1.00_04_57_18.Still008.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

  * **End Screen Effectiveness** : At the end of onboarding, users are shown their **daily calorie goal** —a smart move. It delivers immediate value and shows the product in action. However, there's a slight disconnect: earlier language focused on goals, not calories—then the UI abruptly switches focus.


This onboarding flow, while not flawless, sets the stage for value while collecting valuable data for both personalization and future targeting.

## Paywall

Following onboarding, users arrive at the **dashboard** —but many of the advanced features are blurred or locked behind a paywall. This is a classic **freemium strategy** , and we have some thoughts:

![Locked Features](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/aCNopydWJ-7kSCA__FTF-Sxx-Exx-Template-v1.00_06_00_22.Still012.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

  * **Locked Features as Upsell** : Similar to dating apps blurring premium profiles, MyFitnessPal subtly nudges users toward premium by withholding data visualizations and aggregated metrics.
  * **UI Suggests More Is Locked Than Actually Is** : The perception is “you must pay to do anything,” even if that’s not technically true.


The pricing page itself is well-executed, with two key strengths:

  * **Localized Currency** : Using a VPN test, MyFitnessPal adapts pricing based on user location—USD in the U.S., Euros in Europe, etc. This improves **trust** and reduces hesitation at the moment of purchase. **We found that 92.1% of MyFitnessPal customers were able to pay in their local currency.**
  * **Payment Methods** : MyFitnessPal offers **Cash App Pay** and **card input** but lacks options like PayPal or Apple Pay.

![Localized Pricing](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/aCNorSdWJ-7kSCBE_FTF-Sxx-Exx-Template-v1.00_07_15_03.Still015.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

  * **Younger users prefer Apple/Google Pay** for speed and ease.
  * **Older demographics may lean toward cards**


## Download Friction

After purchase, users are congratulated and reminded that the app is available on Google Play and the App Store. But the **handoff from web to app is minimal** :

  * **No QR Code** : A missed opportunity, especially for desktop users who might want a quick path to download.
  * **Email Delivery Exists—but It’s Hidden** : There's a confirmation message that an email has been sent, but it's buried at the bottom. We recommend moving it **above the fold** and making it more visually prominent.
  * **Contextual Triggers Would Help** : If the funnel detects desktop usage, a smart UI could swap in a QR code or a more aggressive email prompt to drive app downloads.

![Download Friction 2](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/aCNotydWJ-7kSCBL_FTF-Sxx-Exx-Template-v1.00_08_58_22.Still021.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

## Takeaways

**What MyFitnessPal Does Well:**

  1. **Goal-Oriented Onboarding** : The journey is structured to align user intent with the product’s capabilities, using personalization and pacing to good effect.
  2. **End-State Clarity** : Delivering a clear output (your calorie goal) at the end of onboarding gives users a sense of accomplishment and purpose.

![End Screen](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/aCNouSdWJ-7kSCBM_FTF-Sxx-Exx-Template-v1.00_09_38_07.Still022.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

**Opportunities for Improvement:**

  1. **UI and Flow Enhancements** : The design feels a bit dated, and questions could be more nuanced—e.g., asking not just “what’s your goal?” but “why now?” or “what’s your timeline?”
  2. **Improve Transition to Mobile App** : Strengthening the bridge between web purchase and mobile app use (with QR codes, clearer emails, etc.) would likely boost activation and retention.

![Goal Screen](https://images.prismic.io/paddle-studio/aCNouidWJ-7kSCBN_FTF-Sxx-Exx-Template-v1.00_10_05_20.Still023.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=3840)

### Full Interview with Nathan Hudson

00:00:08:00 - 00:00:22:17

Steve

Welcome to fix that funnel. I'm your host, Steve Cerasoli and today we are breaking down the web funnel of my Fitness pal. I know you look at me and you say, Steve, how did you get so shredded? Well, it's thanks to apps like my fitness Pal. With my Fitness Pal, you can track everything from meals to workouts and everything in between.

00:00:22:19 - 00:00:42:20

00:00:57:08 - 00:01:04:07

Steve

That Funnel Tonight!

00:01:04:09 - 00:01:11:11

Ben

However, we the insert on a box of cotton swabs never insert cotton swab into ear canal to remove wax.

00:01:11:12 - 00:01:12:06

Nathan

00:01:12:08 - 00:01:31:19

Ben

Gross. Well, now there's paddle hear merchant of record paddle managers, payments, taxes, invoicing and buyer support automatically. So you sell more, stress less and scale faster. Paddle a merchant of record that clears the way.

00:01:31:21 - 00:01:40:15

Steve

Hey everybody welcome to fix that funnel. Today we are joined by the founder of Perceptycs the app marketer of the year. Everyone welcome Nathan Hudson to the show. Nathan, thanks for being here.

00:01:40:17 - 00:01:43:06

Nathan

No, thank you for having me. It's great to be back.

00:01:43:08 - 00:01:47:00

Steve

So, Nathan, why don't you tell everybody at home what got you into the world of app growth?

00:01:47:01 - 00:02:11:02

Nathan

I'm Nathan Hudson, founder of Perceptycs, where we work with mobile apps ranging from new startups to apps generating 10 million year plus revenue. And we do a lot of work with web app funnels, building funnels, strategizing funnels, analyzing funnels, AB testing, tearing down funnels and just helping apps convert profitably on the web.

00:02:11:04 - 00:02:18:07

Steve

So, Nathan, let's take a step back and look at the big picture here. So we're going to break down MyFitnessPal on the desktop. But most people will actually find it on the mobile web.

00:02:18:10 - 00:02:40:15

Nathan

Why is that? Mobile web is kind of the predominant web platform for most users. TikTok meta. That's kind of where people are spending their time. So most of the time people will be going through these onboarding journeys on mobile, web, but desktop, especially for an app like My Fitness Pal, is going to be relevant to look at because people will sign up on the web if they're in front of their laptop like we are now.

00:02:40:18 - 00:02:49:18

Steve

So my fitness Pal is obviously a behemoth in this space, but what are some things to consider for a large company like My Fitness Pal versus a smaller company just starting out with their web two app.

00:02:49:20 - 00:03:13:00

Nathan

My Fitness Pal. You know they're big company with a big team, and for them, it's not so difficult to implement. But logistically it is, you know, not the easiest thing to do in that you need to be able to take payments on the web. So therefore, you know, a solution like paddle makes a lot of sense. Then they're going to either need a web builder or, you know, have a really savvy front end developer.

00:03:13:01 - 00:03:27:16

Nathan

There are some kind of hacky things you can do to get web funnels up super quickly. But for brand of my fitness power size, they're going to be very concerned about ensuring that the quality of the families is up to par and that the brand kind of echoes throughout that.

00:03:27:18 - 00:03:35:19

Steve

Now that Nathan's laid out some benefits of web Tap, let's dive headfirst into their onboarding.

00:03:35:20 - 00:03:42:18

Steve

So we're interested in My Fitness Pal. We got brought here through an ad or we just wanted to get in shape. But we start off on this page here. What are we seeing right off the bat?

00:03:42:21 - 00:04:03:13

Nathan

So it's kind of two things I'm looking to understand. One, what am I going to get out of this. What is the big promise I can take away. And two what does it do? So for example, I can see that the middle image, what's going on about calories and really pushing some numbers there. I think what's interesting is that they're not pushing the word calories.

00:04:03:15 - 00:04:05:13

Nathan

I'm being told, you know, higher level language.

00:04:05:16 - 00:04:11:17

Steve

So we're seeing a lot of goal based language that's probably common amongst a lot of fitness apps. What purpose does this goal based language serve?

00:04:11:18 - 00:04:33:21

Nathan

They're looking to get data and kind of understand what users are looking to do, because that can influence the acquisition strategy, stuff like this. But beyond that, the main thing is personalization. You can set goals specifically in the app and kind of have have macros and calories set for you. So I'm guessing that this data is going to be used for that, which is is pretty exciting.

00:04:33:21 - 00:04:39:01

Steve

Now what I like here is the onboarding isn't just question after question. We're seeing a lot of interstitials as well. Right?

00:04:39:06 - 00:04:47:20

Nathan

I think as we kind of said before, it breaks up the monotony. But beyond that, it's also just making the user feel more comfortable and willing to actually participate.

00:04:48:01 - 00:04:52:00

Steve

Now, as we continue down our onboarding journey, are there any other things that are sticking out to you?

00:04:52:06 - 00:05:13:04

Nathan

There are an awful lot of answers for each question, and it can kind of lead users to a point of choice paralysis. So I think maybe they could experiment with not having so many and or having like a custom field. But the main reason I say this is just because on mobile, the amount of screen real estate you have to actually scroll through or select and maybe, maybe changing.

00:05:13:06 - 00:05:18:21

Steve

Now as we get to the end here, we're being congratulated. We're seeing our calorie goal. Why is this a great screen to end on?

00:05:18:23 - 00:05:38:08

Nathan

I think this is really interesting. And I'm going to start with the part that kind of confuses me. All of a sudden now everything becomes about calories. So I think it almost feels like there's a slight disconnect there, which would be interesting to to see some data behind. But beyond that, as someone who's a user of the app, I completely get why this is the screen that we're ending on.

00:05:38:10 - 00:05:46:16

Nathan

This is your goal. If you do this, you should maintain your current weight. And I think that's exactly what you came for. And now you've got your answer.

00:05:46:18 - 00:05:54:19

Steve

Now that we've finished up our onboarding, it's time to pull out our credit cards and head over to the paywall.

00:05:54:21 - 00:06:02:17

Steve

Now we finished up our onboarding. We're seeing the dashboard here. It's a freemium play where they kind of blur out all these features. What's the purpose of something like this?

00:06:02:17 - 00:06:21:13

Nathan

Yeah, I mean we see a lot of dating apps, right. So dating apps will blur certain profiles and then kind of lock these behind a paywall. I will make a confession, which is I've use My Fitness Pal every day for the past seven years, and I am not a premium user. I can get all the value I need out of the free products.

00:06:21:16 - 00:06:24:04

Nathan

You can hook people in, but with functionality.

00:06:24:06 - 00:06:30:05

Steve

So Nathan, I think the people in our lovely audience would want to know what would actually get you to sign up for premium MyFitnessPal.

00:06:30:07 - 00:06:55:22

Nathan

For me personally, I have been tracking macros for a while, so I understand the importance of the macros section. Now, on the mobile app you can see macros for foods you just can't see. You know, nice aggregated charts and data as much I don't think there's anything they could actually do to get me to be a premium user other than lock every single macro metric possible, but I think what that goes to show is who they're aiming things for.

00:06:56:01 - 00:07:02:08

Nathan

It says you can't do anything unless you pay. You can. But that's what the UI is suggesting.

00:07:02:11 - 00:07:17:23

Steve

When we actually get to our paywall here, we see that they're doing localized pricing. We ran this page through a VPN and found if we're in Europe, they're charging in euros. If we're in the US, USD, and our data even shows that most people could buy MyFitnessPal in their native currency. So what is the importance of localized pricing?

00:07:18:04 - 00:07:40:14

Nathan

I'm trying to think, have I ever been on a checkout where I saw pricing that wasn't localized and then purchased? I think really it comes down to recognizing how much am I actually going to be charged for this product, and what does that mean? A lot of people may not know what 4999 equates to USD to E or Ila to GPP, so I think that's important in terms of conversion.

00:07:40:16 - 00:07:42:19

Nathan

It's it's a must have.

00:07:42:21 - 00:07:47:12

Steve

And now something we mentioned on every episode payment methods. Are they offering enough payment methods here.

00:07:47:12 - 00:08:08:16

Nathan

It's easy to say the more the marry right. Just add everything card, cash app, Google Pay, Apple Pay. But I think experimentation does need to be done in order to figure out which payment options to have. For example, Cash App Pay is very dominant on this page, right? PayPal is not on this page, but I do think it comes down to understanding one who is actually going to be buying.

00:08:08:16 - 00:08:21:03

Nathan

We've seen that, you know, Apple Pay, Google Pay as fast as possible is what you want to use when you're working with younger audiences 45, 55, even 60 plus. We've seen a lot of them favor card details.

00:08:21:03 - 00:08:30:03

Steve

So we've purchased MyFitnessPal and now it's time to see. Is it easy to go from web over to the app?

00:08:30:05 - 00:08:38:13

Steve

So we've signed up for premium. They're congratulating us, and they're letting us know that there's an app available on the Google Play Store and the App Store. What goes into this last screen here?

00:08:38:13 - 00:09:06:01

Nathan

Having the Apple Store and Google Play buttons there don't really make sense as icons. They make sense because I now know where to go, but chances are I know where to go anyway and they're a little bit more central. So I think a QR code would be more interesting in this case, having that email line that's at the bottom way more prevalent at the top of the screen, I would 100% say have a QR code only if they're on desktop.

00:09:06:03 - 00:09:14:07

Nathan

Make sure whatever platform they're on that it's clear that you've emailed them and have that in large, large copy. I think that's what's missing from this page.

00:09:14:09 - 00:09:19:07

Steve

So now we've wrapped up, we've made it to the other side of My Fitness pal, Nathan. What are two things that are doing really well here?

00:09:19:10 - 00:09:38:10

Nathan

I think there are obviously some things that they've done really well. I think not just having a consistent thread of questions in like a survey type approach and breaking that up with some interstitials and information can be super helpful. And I think the most amazing thing they've done is that but what do I do now? You've just giving me a number.

00:09:38:10 - 00:09:44:22

Nathan

I think that question that arises up in that kind of friction point of I can't do this is what's going to help convert people.

00:09:45:00 - 00:09:48:16

Steve

And with the good always comes some areas of improvement. So what could they be doing? Even better, I.

00:09:48:16 - 00:10:06:03

Nathan

Think the UI itself could be a little bit smoother. You know, it feels a little bit outdated. It's great they break it up, but I think the questions they're asking could go a little bit deeper and kind of be a bit more nuanced, instead of just asking me about my goal, maybe also, why do I want that goal?

00:10:06:03 - 00:10:08:05

Nathan

Is there a specific timeline they have in mind?

00:10:08:10 - 00:10:15:20

Steve

Awesome. Well, I want to thank Nathan Hudson for being here today. Make sure you check out all things Nathan Hudson. Make sure you check out for skeptics. Nathan. Thank you so much for being here.

00:10:15:20 - 00:10:16:20

Nathan

Thank you.

00:10:16:22 - 00:10:37:17

Steve

Now that was a lot of fun. But if you'll excuse me, I got to go hit my macros. Thanks for watching. Fix that phone. I want to thank Nathan Hudson for being here today, and I want to thank you at home. Join us next week when we talk about headway one 1000 to 1000.
