Today on Fix That Funnel, we are joined by the founder of Perceptics, the app marketer of the year, the growth guru himself, Nathan Hudson. Nathan, thank you so much for being on with us, man. Appreciate it.

No. Steve, thank you for having me. Very excited to be here.

Alright. Awesome. So first up, I wanna just get a little insight on, like, your experience and, like, what got you so into the space of, like, app growth and and all the stuff we're talking about today?

Yeah. So I've been I've been in marketing for a while, marketing since I was young. But it was my first role in mobile marketing that kind of excited me and got me introduced to the world of of growth attribution and all these these fun things. And, yeah, haven't really turned back since. So now at Perceptics, we work with whole load of different mobile apps ranging from small startups to apps turning over lots and lots of money, and helping them with their growth. And one of the areas we look at a lot is web to app.

We're talking about Blinkist today. It's kinda one of these companies. I've never really even heard of any of these companies up until starting to, like, do some research for the show where they basically take the whole idea of, like, a spark notes kind of approach. Like, if you remember spark notes and take, like, you know, a a full book and consolidate it down into the key takeaways.

Fifth I think it says fifteen minutes on their website. We also talk about Headway a little later on in the series too. They're a very similar company. If their onboarding flow is, like, almost identical to Blinkist, which is kinda crazy.

Have you used an app before like this at all? Like, are you more of, like, a read the full book kinda guy?

So I haven't used either of the apps, other than to check out onboarding journeys and and product growth. So I've used them kind of from a that perspective, but not as a user. I'm more of a read the book type person, but even then, not too much time to be reading full books. So I completely get the value proposition. It makes a lot of sense.

Well, that being said, let's just jump right in here to their actual strategy here that they're running. So they have this kind of hybrid approach where you can, you know, sign up on the actual app store, you know, double tap the side button, get in super easy. Then they also have, like, a web flow here where you get into a paywall. What is the importance of running a strategy like this? Like, what are some of the benefits here?

Yeah. So I think it comes down to, at Blinkit size, the fact they wanna reach as many people as possible. And they're running a whole of different paid channels. They have referrals.

They have a lot of organic search and organic traction, and they wanna make sure that wherever a prospect lands, there is an opportunity to start and finish the conversion journey. So I think having a web to app funnel for Blinkist makes total sense. There are loads of other reasons. For example, audience expansion.

If we take one of the channels they are running and are running quite well, Meta as an example, when you scale your spend on just app alone, it gets to a point where you begin to struggle to scale any further. You can increase spend, but profitability comes down. When you move some of that spend over to web, you can tap into new pockets of the audience and really expand in different ways. You can also, you know, more easily work with influencers and affiliates and run those kind of campaigns.

You can run YouTube ads and all other channels that you can't just run-in isolation when you're running app to app funnels, so standard app funnels. So I think there's a lot of reason why Blinkist are doing this. But I think for an app of their size now, it's gotta be because they want to make sure that wherever a user is, they can convert.

Before we get into the onboarding flow itself, I noticed that, like, the mobile onboarding screen or the the the screens in the mobile onboarding, there's a lot less screens, and, like, the paywalls are a little more simplified. And then when you go on the web onboarding, it's a little more complicated. Are there, like, differences when you're building out a flow on the web versus building out a flow on the mobile experience? Are there different ways to think about that?

Well, I guess one thing to keep in mind is when we say web funnels, when we think about web to app funnels, even though they're web, they're still probably mobile web and that the majority of users going through them are gonna be on mobile anyway. So then it comes down to what's really the main difference. And I think a big one comes down to the pay or checkout page itself. When you are running a native paywall in app, you know that you're gonna have that Apple prompt after an applicant take the payment and you don't have to worry about adding loads of different payment providers and options for people.

When it comes to WebView, which is why they have, for example, PayPal, Credit Card, Google Pay, Apple Pay, depending on your device, You can take payment different ways, and that's kind of why they're doing this. As far as the funnel itself, there aren't really any hey. When you're running web funnels, you should make sure you have these screens versus in app onboarding funnels, you should have these. It really comes down to testing, and just seeing what what works best.

So you may end up with a shorter or longer web or app funnel depending on the app of the use case. What I would also say to that is if we take, you know, Blinkist, they would have run hundreds and thousands of tests to get to where they are now.

And probably part of the reason why we see these different funnels is because the traffic is slightly different. Whether that goes back to the point I mentioned previously about isolating and calling different channels out like YouTube, which you can do on web.

It could also be that the meta traffic they're pushing, the different users are coming, potentially different age groups. So it's hard to say without looking at their data for sure, but these are some of the things that could be at play.

Let's jump into the onboarding real quick.

But before we jump in, I I was watching one of your videos on your YouTube channel. Make sure to check out Nathan's YouTube channel if you are watching. But you actually mentioned that people, like, conflate the concept of a web funnel with an onboarding flow often, but it's like, that's not the case. Right? Like, sometimes, like, if you have a web to app strategy, it can be a lot more simple than a complex, onboarding flow like Blinkist has. Right?

That's right. I mean, I think nowadays when we say web to app or web monetization, web phones, anything to do with web and app, we think, oh, yeah, that quiz funnel. Right? Well, we're gonna have to answer a whole lot of questions, and then we're gonna see a checkout page.

I think that's become the default and the standard because of apps like Blinkist, Headway, others, Duolingo, these big players who have really maximized and made the most out of these flows. But there are other ways you can run web to app. Right? If we just have a landing page and a checkout page and we run our TikTok ads to that page, in a sense, we have a web to app funnel.

Right? That's exactly what we've got. So there are different ways to do it. Blinkist, for example, have a blog.

And from that blog, you can access the app. And they used to push this a lot more. You know, Headway do this a lot now where you can literally just search Headway blog, find an article, and pretty much every blog is gonna direct you to the onboarding file. So there are different things that you can do and different ways you can leverage the traffic and the pages, but the most common is the web onboarding file or quiz.

So let's jump into their quiz right now and see what they've got going on here. It's interesting right off the bat. We saw something similar with Headway. They start off with kind of this h one right off the bat, grow to be the most interesting person in the room. What does this do for their first screen here? Like, how does this get a customer to start the actual journey?

Well, I guess one thing is we're looking at this from their their website.

Right? And most users probably aren't going to come the route we came. They're either coming from a ad creative or somewhere else. So that ad creative would have had some sort of messaging, and they may have been using different landing pages prior to this page that have different messaging.

If not, then this title, grow to be the most interesting person in the room, calls out the value proposition. Right? It's the core job to be done that they're trying to address, and they're trying to reach out for their audience and reel them in. So having this provides context and kind of hooks you in. Now I'd be interested to see whether or not different ad creatives that they're running are pointing to different page ones with different h ones because they quite, well, might be. But this would be the main reason for this.

Awesome. Cool. Let's keep going here. We saw something similar with Headway as well. Social proof is kinda everywhere throughout this flow.

Like, you you kinda get questions, then you get hit with social proof, then questions again. What purpose does that serve in the flow? Like, how important is it to have social proof?

Typically, we see the biggest drop off on page one. So the page that we just saw and now, we're expecting to see a huge drop off. So if we can get people past these points, then probably we're gonna get them close to the end of the funnel or the table. So I think the reason of showing this much social proof upfront is to kind of let people know, hey.

Look. We're serious. We are a big player. We're trustworthy. You don't need to worry. We really can do what we say we can do.

And what we said we can do is make you become the most interesting person in the room, so you should stick around. And I think that's kind of why they're they're pushing that even with the the testimonial that we see in the the middle or the the quote rather from New York Times, it's still honing in on that value proposition. Right? Acquiring and absorbing as much information as possible.

So it kind of ties to that h one that we just saw, the main header, grow to become the most interesting person in the room. So they're really doing these things. They're letting you know you're in the right place because this is what we offer, and they're giving you that proof that they can actually deliver on the promise.

Yeah. They really hammer it home. And then, yeah, after that, you get you start kinda building your profile up, and they start sort of broad, and then they get a little more a little more, like, deeper as you go along. Is there a reason for that too, like, starting off kind of broad and then working your way to more deeper questions?

I've seen both work. Right? So sometimes we start deeper, and then end with some some shallow question. It could be just to warm people up into the the funnel.

It could be because they are really interested in certain data, and they wanna collect that data, so they can figure out information and and do some analysis later. And if they ask that question later and people drop off before, they haven't captured that. I would assume that is one of the main reasons why. Because, really, you wanna start with hooking them in.

Like, why what are you hoping for? We've already made a promise. Now we wanna get them personally invested in the journey, which is what we see right here. Right?

Like, which areas do you want to grow? So I'm not sure as to why exactly they have that age question first. Oftentimes, I've actually seen that having age first can hinder conversion because if not age, gender rather, hinder conversion because people just don't want to give that that information. But they've obviously got the data and their reasons, so there's gonna be something else at play.

We talked to Jacob Rushfin yesterday, and he had a interesting point too about kinda having, like if you're going through the flow, it's like you give the company a little bit of information about yourself, and then you get a little bit a little bit back in return. You can kinda see it if we keep going through here, like, these questions here. So you, like, you answer a question, and then it'll kinda give you something interesting about about your response. Is that, like, a common strategy that you see?

Yeah. It's common. It should be more common. I think there's a lot to unpack. I think the push pull analogy is a nice one.

I like to think of it as starting from basics. Why do we have an onboarding journey? Right. Now a lot of mobile developers, a lot of, you know, publishers, from our perspective, the reason we have the onboarding journey is to one, collect data, two, understand our customer, and three, convince them that our products are the best.

But from the user's perspective, neither of those things are particularly relevant. Maybe the third one's slightly. I don't necessarily care if your product's the best. I just wanna know, is it gonna do what I think it's going to do?

Or is it gonna do what I need it to do? Without giving the information, it's hard to communicate that. So I like to call them interstitial pages, which are basically those pages in between questions where you break up the monotony of asking questions and you you add value. Now what's great about bank list, though, is and you can see this if you click on one of these and then, you know, go forward and then go back and then click on the next one.

Depending on which answer you click at any given question, the the next one's a great example because you won't have to click continue. So depending on what what answer you're you're clicking, you get a different interstitial. And the reason is because they're trying to, you know, resonate with you and build empathy. I think that's one of the things that is really important about the onboarding journey is the goal is not to ask questions.

It's to connect with the user. And on top of that, the goal is to answer their questions. So if I'm coming to a product and I'm answering these questions, more questions are gonna rise in my head. You're asking, am I decisive?

I'm thinking, oh, am I decisive enough? Am I too decisive? So what they're really doing here is just reassuring users and kind of building a digital relationship, if you wanna put it that way, with the the potential future customer.

Yeah. It is interesting. It's like yeah. When we were talking to Jacob too, it's like he he mentioned a lot of this is a lot of these questions, it's like, how much actually goes into tailoring the product experience to the customer? Like, I'm I'm assuming a lot of it like, a lot of your responses probably do kinda build the product around you a little bit. But is a lot of this just to kinda get people through the door and, like, almost create, like, an experience to kinda kinda, like, hook you into the product.

Blinkist do do a lot of personalization. And I think it's worth saying that, you know, later down the line, you get specific questions around content and other things. I think that's important because when your app offers so much, you wanna ensure that it delivers value for each user. Right? The value that you're expecting isn't gonna be the same as as me. So they wanna make sure that the product is, you know, relevant and personalized.

Now on the flip side of things, there is something at play when we talk about the idea of personalization and just the perception of personalization, which is I as a user am going through this survey, going through this onboarding journey, giving all this knowledge or information and thinking, okay. Cool. Right? This is gonna mean something for me.

Right? You're gonna you're building a profile, especially nowadays. We just assume that there's some AI, at work here, and that makes us think that the experience is gonna be better. So there's really the the twofold.

There is one, actually personalizing, and then two, making users think that it's personalized, which has the added advantage of actually being able to get more money from them. If you're giving me something that's tailored to me and you're charging a specific price point and you're giving something that's just generic and charging the same price point, what you know, the latter I'm not so keen on, but the former, hey, it's all for me, so maybe I'll go for it.

Yeah. Do you are you noticing anything else in Blinkist's flow here as we kind of approach the end that I kinda glossed over? Is there anything about Blinkist specifically that you think's interesting, they do really well?

It's the idea of kind of building excitement about the product. And I think they do that in a lot of ways. Right? If you you notice here, we're talking about celebrating.

We're talking about other things. But they kind of mix the questions they're asking. They don't push you down one thread and then keep going there, but they dart you around to different things. We go from, you know, talking about your job to to something else to to, you know, healthy balance.

It it's great. It's it's engaging because there are some web onboarding journeys that are just quite boring. Right? And you go through them and you think, who cares?

Why does this matter? But they're really covering a lot of ground in a short space of time. So I think that's that's pretty cool.

As we get to the end here, so we have this this is what you're talking about with the kind of the books to kinda personalize your experience. I think this is a cool a cool way of doing it too where they kinda generate these these fake titles here. And then when we get here, there's one more interesting thing I wanna get to real quick. Yeah.

This page here. So as we have this kinda, like, countdown, I thought it was interesting the way that they keep asking you questions while this is loading. I'm assuming, like, it's not actually loading anything, like, particular. It's using this as almost a way to ask you more questions.

Do you see this often? And, like, what does this do in at this time?

So the loader itself is kind of this with personalizing your experience loader, which does a great job of convincing users that they're gonna get something. Right? So making us wait, for that loading process. If we ignore the questions for now, just move the questions, just the loader.

That in itself makes me think something's going on in the background. So the users think, okay, I've I've given you all this information and now you're you're background. So the users think, okay, I've given you all this information and now you're doing something for me, right? You're creating the personal experience.

What we've seen in a lot of products we've worked with is that there can also be a drop off on the screen. One, because of the amount of time waiting, it's just loading, nothing's happening. So it could be that these questions that are coming up that Blinkist are adding are to keep users engaged and keep them on this part of the process and not dropping off. But equally, it's almost as if they're taking these additional inputs into the personalization.

Right? It doesn't say that, and it's not super obvious, but you get the feeling that, okay, you're personalizing, then you've kind of paused. It's not like the loader carries on in the background. You ask me a question, I answer, it loads some more, then the same thing repeats. So I think it it very much is that that sense of, hey. We're doing a amazing job at building the awesome experience personalized for you. And I think that's that's what they capture quite well.

Yeah. It almost builds a little bit of suspense too. Like, you're like, you wanna see that you wanna see that circle get complete just naturally. It's like it's it's built into you.

And then I like this too, this this plan. I'm assuming that this line, you know, it's the same. No matter what questions you choose, you're gonna get this graphic here. But I think it does a good job kind of visualizing out a growth plan.

And if we put our email in here, and then we get hit with our first, paywall pricing page here. What do you notice in here off the bat? I think this countdown clock is interesting to me.

Yeah. The countdown clock is really interesting. I think one thing, again, to keep in mind is we're looking at the desktop version. Right?

So mobile, little different in terms of formatting here. For example, the the the countdown is a little more obvious on mobile than it is here. But even so, it's it's great. There's a countdown.

There's a discount. What's interesting to me particularly is how they anchor things and and what they're doing here. Because typically, when you think about, you know, checkout page, you think about offering different plans. Right?

You think about offering a monthly plan or a quarterly plan or a yearly plan and having users pick between those. But Blinkist aren't doing that here. They're essentially only offering you a twelve month plan. Like, whatever you pick, it's gonna be twelve months.

You can either pick the more expensive one or the cheaper one. And I think this is really interesting because there is always this this kind of push to get more annual subscribers because it becomes easier to optimize paid traffic for. It becomes, you know, a lot safer for developers in terms of payback periods, etcetera. But when you anchor an expensive offering with a less expensive offering that has a few different features, it's almost a win win for that.

The most popular one is obviously the more expensive one. Whether or not that's true, we don't know. What it means is I only have three options. I either go for the expensive one, twelve months, great for Blinkist.

I go for one that's slightly cheaper, but still a good price, seventy nine point nine nine, great for Blinkist.

Or I x app. But it means that they're they're essentially keeping the, you know, average revenue per customer as high as possible versus having a weekly, monthly, even quarterly plan on the screen. And there's one other thing actually, which is worth it. It's the the anchoring on daily pricing.

We do a lot of experimentation around if it's a twelve month plan, do we wanna show the monthly price, the weekly price, or the daily price?

It it does come down to what's the smallest number you can give, without becoming ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend anyone puts per hour. But per day, like, twenty two cents per day, thirty nine cents, it's cheap. Right?

It feels like a no brainer. And I think especially after going through that massive onboarding journey, committing all that time, giving all that information, you get to this point and you're like, maybe I should just give in. Right? And I and I've spoken to a lot of people who've said that, yeah, they just end up trying it because they've already invested the time.

But I think that aside, at this price point, it feels like a no brainer, which is good.

I am not sure at the moment if they're offering a trial. I don't think they have a trial on web, and and I don't think Headway do either. I'm not sure about in app, though. They may have a trial in app. But I think what's interesting here is that they're going straight for the purchase for for many reasons.

One, because, you know, trial conversion can be tough, and you gotta account for that with your your overall, you know, marketing, efforts, which I think is specifically interesting when you're really trying to scale with paid acquisition. It's almost a case of, can we make the money back same day as opposed to same week? That can make a world of difference because it means tomorrow when we're judging the metrics and we're looking at what's happened, we've got full understanding of yesterday's data without having to wait and cohort and bash things.

So we put this through a VPN, and, you know, dollar signs changed to euros. I think the price actually changed itself too. If we go back to my thing here, it gets charged for I think it was the platinum plan was two hundred fifty nine ninety nine euro. So I thought it was interesting too, like, that they're doing true localized pricing.

Yes.

Do you wanna talk just a little bit about the importance of localizing pricing?

Literally, just ten minutes ago, I was on a call, and we were speaking about localizing to move into India, into a completely different market. What we've been predominantly spending in the US is super important because you may not think of it that much when you're the developer or the publisher because you're focused on all these other things. But for the end user, price is the biggest indicator or the biggest thing that's gonna, you know, determine a decision. And whether or not they understand what that price means is largely dependent on what currency you display the price in.

So always localize. Yeah. It has to be that way. One kind of tip or or bonus thing I'll throw in here is it's hard to localize for every region or it can be.

It's not necessarily the easiest. And if you're using images and kind of static banners, it becomes even more difficult because you have to then change every single banner. So if you notice here, the price is really only on this this one kind of your plan area where it can easily be updated dynamically, like you said, based on region. Whereas if they were using images and stuff like this, that becomes, you know, more complex.

Of course, it's easy to do. It's still easy to do, but it's just another overhead to consider, changing. The same applies in app. Now there are a lot of updates, like with RevenueCat's Payroll Builder where you can, for example, have the banners, and you can change those banners based on on region.

And, historically, it wasn't so easy to do that. So that's one thing that they've got they've got really well here and people should definitely consider.

That's very interesting. I've never really thought about that that banner thing that the banner concept and how it's like, if it's baked into an image, you gotta, you know, alter all of those images to to Yeah. Reflect a different yeah. No.

It's I mean, it can be done for sure.

Right? Like, you can dynamically render the image. Mhmm. But sometimes it's easier. It's just not.

Similarly to the localized pricing, multiple payment methods, that's something we love to talk about here at Paddle, obviously. What's the importance of having just a diverse set of payment options?

So I think it comes back to the point that we kick this whole thing off with, which was essentially making your product available to as many people as possible. One of the main reasons to run a web funnel is to do that and reach different audiences and expand. And with that comes, you know, a different battleground where you have to essentially handle the payments yourself. Now, different ages, different users often convert on web versus in app.

We often see, for example, older audiences converting through web funnels that wouldn't necessarily convert direct to app. And with that means different payment methods. Some people may not be comfortable giving their color details. Some people may not use PayPal.

Some people may just want a quick option, Google Pay, Apple Pay, which is important to to include that. What we've seen is that the the kind of starting point should be less have as many as possible. Right? What are all the options that we can give people they can then pick?

And I think the one thing I'll say is it ties very much to localization, which is don't just assume that every country in the world wants PayPal, credit card, and Google Pay. It's it's not it's not necessarily the case. Right? Our discussion earlier that we're having about, you know, moving to Indian market, we're very much trying to figure out how we can actually add UBI as a payment, you know, so as for people to use.

That wouldn't be relevant in the in the US. But thinking those things through and thinking, okay. In Uganda, how do people take payments? How does that differ to India and the UK and the US?

And then making sure that you have, you know, payment mechanisms for each of those regions.

Yeah. It's like it's easy. If you're selling out of the US, it's like it's easy to think, you know, everyone buys stuff the same way we hear in the US buy stuff, but it's like, it's not the case. You know?

It's like, you know, people in China use Alipay. We've you know, people in the Netherlands use Ideal. There's all these all sorts of payment options that, you know, a lot of people don't even know exist around the world. So it's it's very it's very interesting space.

And then the last thing we can talk about real quick is once we actually hit continue on here and we subscribe, we put our credit card in, hit that, get that one forty dollar charge. So we get this screen here, which makes it super easy to go from the web to the actually get the app. All you gotta do is scan the QR code, and then boom, App Store opens up on your phone. When we were looking at Headway, they didn't have a screen like this.

So I thought it was interesting. Like, how important is it to have something where, you know, you're making it as frictionless as possible going from the web to the app? Yeah.

I think based on what I've said already about making it easy for people, the assumption will be I'm gonna say it's super important.

Actually, though, I would say arguably not so important in this case. And the reason I say that is because, again, most people will be on mobile web, so they won't actually need to scan a QR code. They can just click a button.

And that would be smooth enough for people. However, it does make sense to have a QR code for those users who are on desktop who may not necessarily want to go and get their phone and find it on the way. But I say that because you can still email, and I think that is something that Blinkist do do and should always be done regardless of whether or not there is a QR code on the payment completion page, which is essentially remind people that they've got an email. Right?

I know Blink has sent an email. I'm just looking through. I don't think they've told me that they've sent an email. Oh, yes.

Well, you get your subscription confirmation. Right? But I think adding, hey, you know, we've sent you an email so you can actually access your account Could be another great thing and another great way and for people to access their account, and it's what we do quite a lot.

Our last thing that we wanna do is just break down a couple key takeaways, two areas that you think that Blinkist did really, really well in. If you get some ideas on on what what, like, a company watching this should take away from Blinkist.

Yeah. So the number one thing I'd say is breaking up the monophony of asking questions. I think we saw that throughout the journey that there were some instances where not only do when I select an answer, I see something on screen, but when I click continue, I then see an interstitial that has information. I think that's super super great, because it breaks up the, say, monotony of just, okay, here I am filling in a quiz waiting to get to the end.

You wanna keep people engaged through the flow, and they do that really well. The other thing I'd say they do quite well is asking deep, engaging questions, not just surface level questions. Right? Like, it's it's it's easy for them as well because of the type of app they are, which kind of ties to the point where it kind of ties to the point of should you be building out this type of quiz funnel.

It depends. Right? They can ask some really deep questions, get you hooked in, speak about your job, your financial situation, your relationship, how you make decisions, how you feel about yourself, and it not feel weird. But if you are like a weather app, asking those questions is gonna make no sense.

Yep. So you may want to revisit the strategy entirely.

But I think those are two things they do specifically well, and I think people should pay attention to those.

What's an area where you think they could grow even more, like, going into this year? Like, what's something that they could experiment with to just further drive their growth?

This is a a big one and a personal one, but the content of the interstitial screens themselves.

So when you click yes on an answer and you have a message that comes up, sometimes and I and I feel this with headway as well. It just feels a little forced. Like, the message just feels I don't want it not cringey, but there's just something that feels, like, very forced. And I don't know whether that's just because me, you know, as an operator, I'm in this space, and and I'm not the user.

But I think there's almost something to be done or an opportunity to make it feel more personal. I don't mean personalized. I mean, just more personal. Like, really connect with me.

I think the questions are great, but I don't know whether the screens that that tell me about the product and tell me about some a decision are right. And I and I'm thinking on it more. And I think it could be that the onboarding is a sort of yes, man. Right?

If you know what I mean? And what I mean by this is I was speaking to someone the other week, and their onboarding journey is very not a yes, man. It's all about challenging you. And it does challenge you.

You pick an answer, and then it asks, like, what do you think is great about this, though? Do you think you should improve this? And it makes you feel like you're investing in your personal growth. Blinkist are about personal growth, but yet the onboarding journey feels like I'm already there.

You know, it feels like it's patting me on the back at every question, and I think it would be interesting to experiment with challenging my thinking and thought process. Again, maybe they've already done this and it didn't work for them. But I know that as a user myself, I absolutely would be more likely to convert through a fund like that. Therefore, there are other people like that, which leads to the second point, which is if there's a way for them to identify these types of people early on, then really customizing the onboarding journey entirely.

Yeah. I think an app like Blinkist is probably looking into or or could be looking into, like, generative AI onboarding journeys, but I think that would be be super cool, to make them a lot more dynamic.

If they were to ask a question along the lines of, like, do you like to be challenged? I mean, they could definitely write something better than that. But, like, you know, depending on that response, it's like the the it informs the rest of the onboarding flow. Yeah.

I totally feel the same way when I was going through it. It felt like I was constantly being patted on my back even no matter what answer I hit. But, yeah, super interesting. Thank you so much, Nathan.

I really appreciate you, running through this with us, man.
