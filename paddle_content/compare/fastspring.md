FastSpring began as an MoR for e-commerce companies before venturing into SaaS and digital products. Much of its underlying infrastructure was built for e-commerce companies, adapted later for SaaS and digital products.

Paddle's API-led platform was built for developers in mind. Digital product companies are born global, so you can sell and receive payouts in more currencies compared to FastSpring. Plus, unlock smart churn prevention tools, all in one platform.
