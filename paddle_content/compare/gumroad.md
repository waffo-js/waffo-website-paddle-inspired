Gumroad is a [merchant of record](/blog/what-is-merchant-of-record) (MoR) and e-commerce platform for creators and small businesses selling digital products, including books, memberships, courses, and more. They take on some, but not all sales tax liability.   
  
Fee: 10% per transaction

Paddle is an MoR and provider of all-in-one payments and billing tooling for anyone [selling software](https://www.paddle.com/solutions/sell-software-online) or [digital products](https://www.paddle.com/solutions/sell-digital-products). Paddle includes customer billing support and takes on full sales tax liability, globally.  
  
Fee: 5% + 50¢ per transaction

## Launch, grow, thrive

Gumroad offers useful out-of-the-box features for small businesses and is simple for developers to set up – making it popular for side-hustles and start-ups.

Paddle has what you need to get started selling your digital products, but also provides what you need to power growth models: flexible recurring billing, subscription analytics, global payment methods and more.

## Tax headaches gone

Despite being an MoR, Gumroad doesn't take full liability for sales tax. Paddle does. [Wherever you sell](https://www.paddle.com/help/start/intro-to-paddle/which-countries-are-supported-by-paddle), we handle sales tax remittance – fighting fraud, chasing chargebacks, managing reconciliation, and ensuring compliance along the way.
