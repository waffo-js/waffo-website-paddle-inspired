## **The company**

[Photomyne](https://photomyne.com/) is a treasure chest of family nostalgia, changing our relationship with photographic memories. With 45 million downloads, it has become the go-to platform for preserving the past. 

Starting life as an easy, speedy, and high-quality AI-powered solution to scan hundreds of photos into digital albums in minutes, Photomyne now offers a full suite of apps that enable you to scan multiple types of media: from photos and slides to negatives and kids’ art. 

Having evolved its principal app into an AI nostalgia powerhouse, Photomyne looked to expand its business and increase sales on the web. 

Here’s how Paddle helped the team achieve this goal... 

## **The challenges**

Founded in 2014, Photomyne has grown within Apple and Google’s ecosystems, where the 30% or 15% fee covers global payments, customer refunds, chargebacks, and sales tax compliance worldwide. 

However, over time, the team looked at expanding to the web as an additional opportunity.

> Previously, we had been sourcing and onboarding online traffic from the web. After we realized we could take payments via the web too, we immediately saw it was an opportunity we couldn’t pass up on.”

Mickey Atir, CMO, Photomyne 

Whilst the benefits are plentiful, acquiring new types of customers and taking payments on the web forces businesses like Photomyne to think about sales tax and compliance. 

## **The solution**

After evaluating several options, Photomyne landed on Paddle and the [Merchant of Record](https://www.paddle.com/blog/what-is-merchant-of-record) model to help handle global payments and tax compliance. 

> We did consider the fact that Paddle takes a bigger commission than others that do not handle tax, like PSPs. But on balance, we decided that Paddle’s fee was the more cost-effective option.”

Tal Katz, CFO, Photomyne

A swift implementation followed, with Paddle’s solution experts acting as an extension of the Photomyne team to get the migration done quickly.

> We got to work with some great people from Paddle who were able to just figure everything out. It was very easy, and the full migration was complete in a matter of weeks.”

Tal Katz, CFO, Photomyne

## **The results**

### **Diverse payment methods boost conversions**

With 17+ languages, 29+ local currencies, and a diverse range of payment options, integration with Paddle immediately addressed a critical pain point for Photomyne:

> One thing that was great when we moved to Paddle was the ability to use PayPal, which we didn't have before.”

Mickey Atir, CMO, Photomyne

The addition of one-click Apple and Google Pay helped streamline the checkout process. 

> The one-tap payment options have made it easier for users to make the move to pay and have increased conversions.”

Mickey Atir, CMO, Photomyne

### Tax compliance made simple

Paddle transformed Photomyne's approach to global tax compliance.

> We don't need to do any of the calculations. We don't need to have an employee dedicated to that. It’s a huge time and resource saver.”

Tal Katz, CFO, Photomyne

### **Scaling Web2App with Paddle**

Photomyne successfully tapped into a new audience demographic, discovering that their web users skewed older and responded well to email communication. 

This targeted strategy not only boosted conversion rates but also deepened customer relationships.

The system also enables greater marketing flexibility.

> One thing that we were able to try this year on Paddle is the coupons. It’s really helped us scale over the last 6–8 months.”

Tal Katz, CFO, Photomyne

This capability represents exactly what makes Web2App strategies successful—the ability to leverage web marketing channels to drive qualified users toward conversion points on the web. 

By utilizing coupons and Paddle’s flexible pricing, Photomyne has enhanced their customer acquisition strategy.

> Using Web2App makes sense—it helps us meet our audience where they are and guide them through a smoother purchasing journey”

Tal Katz, CFO, Photomyne

## **The future**

With no signs of slowing down, the team are looking forward to growing their web channels further with Paddle powering payments.

> Considering the size of our web revenue channel and our plans, Paddle is the perfect solution.”

Mickey Atir, CMO, Photomyne

As part of their future strategy and scaling efforts, Photomyne plans to transition to Paddle Billing to leverage advanced features, particularly around analytics and subscription management, to enhance retention, optimize conversion paths, and improve the overall customer lifecycle. 

> We’re looking forward to leveraging Paddle Billing’s enhanced features as we continue to scale”

Tal Katz, CFO, Photomyne

As Photomyne continues to prove, partnering with the right payment provider isn't just about managing transactions—it’s about unlocking new growth opportunities that might otherwise be left on the table.
