## **The company**

[AddMaple](https://addmaple.com/) is evolving the way organizations engage with data. 

By enabling users to analyze any survey export format (SAV, CSV, Excel) without manual preparation, AddMaple democratizes data analysis for researchers, product teams, and business analysts. 

Faced with the typical challenges innovative but young companies face when selling globally, AddMaple landed on Paddle as a solution to their growing complexity. 

After winning [Paddle's AI Launchpad program,](https://www.paddle.com/events/webinars/paddle-ai-launchpad-demo-day) we caught up with their founder, Ange, to learn more about their Paddle journey...

## **The challenge**

Having developed its early product proposition, AddMaple found themselves at a critical crossroads. They had a polished solution ready for market, but lacked the infrastructure to sell it globally. 

Without a reliable way to manage payments across regions, AddMaple couldn't effectively distribute their product to potential customers worldwide.

As a bootstrapped startup, they needed to establish credibility with enterprise clients who might hesitate to work with a new, unproven company. 

The complexities of managing tax compliance across different regions and jurisdictions also threatened to divert valuable resources away from product development and growth.

> The tax implications globally are something we didn't have bandwidth for at all. Paddle took that headache away! And they help us manage our subscriptions - All of this means that Paddle enabled us to launch in the first place!"

Ange, Founder, AddMaple

With built-in support for multiple currencies and regions, Paddle enabled AddMaple to launch globally without worrying about payment preferences or regional compliance issues.

> It was a no-brainer looking at it from the customer point of view because you could pay by credit card, you support invoice billing, but also Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal.”

Ange, Founder, AddMaple

## The results

### 45x year-on-year revenue growth

Using Paddle AddMaple saw their revenue multiply 45x. 

This growth was directly enabled by Paddle's global payment management, invoice billing, multi-currency support, and ability to handle complex tax requirements - challenges that could have otherwise hindered their expansion.

The scale of this success became evident when the founder reviewed their year-end performance in Paddle's dashboard.

> I said in the interview that our growth was 12x, but that was an understatement! I looked back and our year on year growth was actually 45x from last year thanks to Paddle. As a small startup, we were able to launch and grow substantially.”

Ange, Founder, AddMaple

### **Enhanced credibility to secure enterprise clients**

As a bootstrapped startup, AddMaple found that partnering with Paddle delivered an unexpected advantage: immediate credibility in the B2B space.

Paddle's established reputation helped AddMaple win enterprise clients who might have hesitated to work with a new market entrant. This opened doors to lucrative customer relationships that may have remained closed to a startup without such a partnership.

> Another thing I love about Paddle is that when you're simply launching your product, it just helps give you a little bit more credibility. As a brand new entrant into the marketplace, it's actually helped us secure some enterprise client deals because Paddle itself is an established player in the market and we can lean on that credibility.”

Ange, Founder, AddMaple

### **Streamlined revenue monitoring**

Tracking growth across different payment methods would typically require juggling multiple tools and reports.

Paddle's unified dashboard eliminated this complexity, giving AddMaple clear visibility into their business performance.

The team could now monitor both invoice billing and credit card payments in one place, saving time and providing clearer insights into their growing customer base.

> What I love about Paddle is how easy it makes things because it supports the invoice billing and then credit card billing too, it really breaks things up so I can monitor growth without having to dive into another tool.”

Ange, Founder, AddMaple

### **Successful localized pricing strategy**

After connecting with other founders in Paddle's AI Launchpad program, AddMaple implemented country-specific pricing to better serve markets with different economic conditions.

Paddle's support for multiple currencies and localized checkout experiences made this possible without additional development work. The result was improved penetration in regions where purchasing power varies significantly, balancing revenue growth with fair pricing.

> I've wanted to implement localized pricing. I love philosophically being able to support people in their own currency, but also looking at price parity because why should people who live in other countries pay excessively more for the same product when you compare their earnings.”

Ange, Founder, AddMaple

## **The future**

With their payments and compliance now fully managed by Paddle, the AddMaple team is focused on continued international expansion and product development.

As a participant in Paddle's AI Launchpad program, AddMaple has gained valuable strategic guidance, helping them refine their ideal customer profile and sustainable growth strategy.

> Paddle enabled us to start the journey in the first place, to receive our first-ever payment. And then thanks to the AI Launchpad, Paddle has helped us to grow and understand how to maintain the energy and strategy to keep growing.”
