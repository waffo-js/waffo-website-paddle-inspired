## **The company**

Founded in 2020, [Stape](https://stape.io/ ) is an all-in-one solution for server-side tracking. 

Unlike traditional tracking methods, which rely on client-side scripts running in users’ browsers, Stape’s approach isn’t affected by ad blockers or browser restrictions.

This results in more accurate and reliable insights into customer behavior that help users optimize their marketing efforts. 

> Our goal is to simplify server-side tracking implementation and hosting, making it as effortless as possible for our clients. We work with over 400 global partners, including Meta, Google, and Snapchat, serving over 150,000 clients in over 100 countries.”

Serge Shkvarnytskyi, Head of B2B and Partnerships at Stape 

Stape prides itself on its simplified pricing structure which allows customers to pay a predictable flat fee, making it easier for them to manage costs.

> This is a big benefit of Stape compared to conventional cloud solutions that charge for CPU load and other variables. We only charge based on incoming traffic – nothing else.”

Dan Murovtsev, Project Manager at Stape

## **The challenge**

Before implementing Paddle, Stape faced several significant challenges. 

Its accountants had identified that it had crossed tax thresholds in multiple regions, including Canada and Australia. This led to an administrative burden that was difficult to manage since its existing payments solution - Stripe - was not able to handle cross-border tax compliance. 

> Our finance team was spending a significant amount of time managing tax compliance issues across different jurisdictions. 
> 
> At this point, to manage all this ourselves, we would have needed to establish local entities in different countries – including remote areas – which would have been a logistical nightmare.” 

Dan Murovtsev, Project Manager at Stape 

Stape’s lack of proper tax handling was not only adding unnecessary risk, but hampering its capacity for growth.

> We anticipated hitting similar tax thresholds in additional countries as we continued to grow, that’s when we realized we needed to take a closer look at how we were handling our payments.” 

Serge Shkvarnytskyi, Head of B2B and Partnerships at Stape

## **The solution**

Realizing it needed a [Merchant of Record (MoR) to manage its payments and liabilities](https://www.paddle.com/blog/what-is-merchant-of-record), Stape began a review of the market. 

> We looked at several MoR providers, but Paddle stood out for its ease of integration and predictable pricing structure; we also received great feedback from one of Paddle’s existing customers.”

Serge Shkvarnytskyi, Head of B2B and Partnerships at Stape

With the decision made, Stape took a phased approach to implementation, first conducting thorough testing through development and quality assurance environments. It then gradually rolled out Paddle to specific regions.

The full implementation took a few weeks. 

> The transition was smooth, and our developers didn’t raise any major concerns” 

Dan Murovtsev, Project Manager at Stape 

## **The results**

Paddle’s simple and predictable billing solution is providing Stape with several benefits: 

### **Removed the tax compliance burden**

With Paddle as its MoR, Stape no longer has to manage the burden of tax compliance itself, nor does it have to set up local entities or representatives. 

> After switching to Paddle, we optimized the accounting team’s time and reduced costs associated with third-party local accounting firms for tax tracking in these countries” 

Serge Shkvarnytskyi, Head of B2B and Partnerships at Stape

### **Future-proofed growth**

Stape can now expand into regions where it previously couldn't operate due to tax compliance issues, without any additional administrative burden.

> With Paddle, we have protected ourselves for the future. It has helped us streamline operations and compliance outside the EU into countries such as Canada and the UK, without additional legal overheads” 

Serge Shkvarnytskyi, Head of B2B and Partnerships at Stape

### **Simplified payment management**

With Paddle, Stape’s finance team are finding it much easier to handle payment questions from customers. 

> Whenever there was a payment question, the finance team would say, 'Oh, they’re on Paddle now, so that should be easier.' ” 

Serge Shkvarnytskyi, Head of B2B and Partnerships at Stape

## **Future plans**

With Paddle on its side, Stape is now fully focused on continuing its rapid growth. 

> We want to get bigger, better, faster and stronger. We will do that by expanding our product portfolio and building our presence in new regions – all while maintaining a strong focus on customer satisfaction and service improvements.”
