## The company 

[Gleap ](https://www.gleap.io/)is the customer feedback and bug reporting tool making app and software development easier. 

Co-founders Lukas Bohler and Isabella Salzmann were previously running a software development agency and struggled with bug reporting tools that lacked crucial information and slowed down development times. 

They decided to create an internal tool that gathered all the essential information necessary to fix bugs. The product soon attracted growing interest from developers outside of the agency. 

> Seeing the potential, we decided to transform it into a full-fledged product available to other companies facing similar challenges.”

Lukas Böhler, Co-founder and CEO, Gleap

Eventually evolving into a customer feedback suite, Gleap now incorporates features like user surveys, feature requests, and in-app messaging, serving software and app developers all over the world. 

## The challenge

With global growth comes sales complexity.

As Gleap continued its expansion, they quickly realized maintaining sales tax compliance across a diverse range of territories wasn’t something they could face alone. Although they were using Stripe to take payments, it still left them with the responsibility of managing, collecting and remitting sales tax wherever they were liable. 

They would need a new partner adept at handling global payments, a partner who could help them scale; enter Paddle.

## The solution

### Going global, compliantly

> We were looking at solutions for managing sales tax as that was beginning to get more complicated but we weren't thinking of replacing Stripe initially. It was only once Paddle reached out and showed us that there was a simpler way to do everything”

Lukas Böhler, Co-founder and CEO, Gleap

Paddle, with its Merchant of Record model, immediately stood out to the team.

As a [Merchant of Record](https://www.paddle.com/blog/what-is-merchant-of-record), Paddle acts as the middleman between Gleap and their customers. It takes on all the risks and responsibilities associated with managing payments, honoring refunds and chargebacks, fraud protection, and sales tax.

### Seamless integration 

Transitioning to a new payments solution is a major move for any business, especially one with a rapidly growing and global customer base.

From day one, Paddle provided hands-on support, guiding Gleap through each stage of implementation with an emphasis on transparency, security, and minimal friction. This was also bolstered by Paddle’s easy-to-follow [developer documentation](https://developer.paddle.com/). 

From Gleap's perspective, getting up and running with Paddle was smooth and efficient.

> Migrating existing subscribers from Stripe to Paddle was also straightforward for us. 
> 
> Paddle provided clear guidelines and support throughout the process, ensuring all subscriber data was transferred securely and accurately. The transition was seamless, with minimal disruption to our customers and no major technical issues.
> 
> Their easy integration, global payment management, built-in tax compliance, and flexible pricing models made it straightforward for us to handle subscriptions and payments. Paddle's user-friendly dashboard and excellent support also helped streamline our operations.”

## The results

### **15% month-on-month revenue growth**

By offloading sales tax compliance and leveraging Paddle’s smart payments solution, Gleap has achieved a consistent growth in revenue.

> The automated tax system has reduced our administrative workload considerably, allowing our team to focus on growth rather than compliance. This efficiency, combined with Paddle's streamlined payments solution has contributed to a continuous 15% growth in our revenue month over month.”

Lukas Böhler, Co-founder and CEO, Gleap

### **Uplift in payment acceptance globally**

An MoR that offers flexible payment options is invaluable for any business with global growth ambitions.

Each region has unique payment preferences, and by tailoring the checkout experience to meet these local demands, sellers can create a seamless payment journey that increases conversions and drives revenue growth. 

Whether it’s Alipay in China or IDEAL in the Netherlands, new payment methods can be added in just a couple of clicks.

> Using Paddle has positively impacted our payment acceptance rates globally. By supporting multiple payment methods and currencies, Paddle ensures our customers can pay in their preferred way, reducing friction and improving overall acceptance rates. This has helped us reach and retain more customers worldwide.”

Lukas Böhler, Co-founder and CEO, Gleap

### Expanding into new markets with ease

While the idea of scaling into new markets is always attractive, tax complexity can make expansion extremely difficult. By partnering with Paddle, this is no longer a concern for the Gleap team, who can instead concentrate on their product and business development.

> By simplifying global payments and handling all aspects of tax compliance, Paddle has enabled us to expand into new markets without the usual administrative burden. This has allowed us to reach a wider international audience and focus more on enhancing our product.”

Lukas Böhler, Co-founder and CEO, Gleap

## The future

Gleap’s vision is to become “the #1 feedback tool” that everyone integrates as the first step when starting any app or web project. This simply isn’t a goal they can achieve while keeping an eye on compliance, sales tax or payment optimization. 

> We want to make collecting and managing feedback effortless and indispensable. With Paddle’s support, we can focus on achieving this vision by expanding globally, optimizing our pricing strategies, and streamlining operations. Paddle’s platform allows us to scale smoothly, reach more customers, and continuously grow our business.”
