## The company

Founded in 2017, [Bouncer](https://www.usebouncer.com/) is a leading email verification platform that helps businesses maintain clean email lists, improve deliverability, and protect sender reputation. 

The platform verifies email addresses without sending actual emails, identifying invalid or risky addresses before they impact deliverability metrics or damage sender reputation.

Founder Radek Kaczynski identified a critical communication problem while working in the US. Truck drivers' email addresses were often recorded incorrectly due to various accents when provided over the counter at dealerships. These errors not only disrupted immediate service communications but also contaminated customer databases, affecting surveying processes and sales opportunities throughout the organization.

From inception, Bouncer adopted a global-first approach, focusing on creating an exceptional verification engine that could navigate these issues seamlessly. 

But with a great product often comes global payment challenges, here’s how Bouncer conquered them. 

## The challenge 

As Bouncer's global customer base expanded, they encountered several significant challenges with their existing payment infrastructure that threatened to impede growth. 

Using Braintree and NummusPay, operations became increasingly difficult to manage as transaction volume grew from dozens to hundreds of monthly transactions. 

But the platform wasn't designed to scale and the finance team quickly found themselves spending disproportionate time on manual administrative tasks that added no value to the core business or customer experience.

> Back then, I had to print all the invoices manually, send them and bring them back to the accountants."

Radek Kaczynski, Founder, Bouncer.

> This, layered atop the complex international tax regulations Bouncer faced caused the team to look for a new solution. 

This time they needed a comprehensive payment solution that could scale alongside their business while reducing the operational burden on their team.

## The solution

Already sold on the [Merchant of Record](https://www.paddle.com/blog/what-is-merchant-of-record) (MoR) model, Bouncer needed a new solution well equipped for global growth. 

As a Merchant of Record, Paddle handles all aspects of payment management, tax compliance, and financial operations.

The solution, alongside Paddle’s collaborative approach from the offset, made things crystal clear for Radek and the team. 

> Even in the early days long before we migrated, I could tell that there was a real collaborative approach (with Paddle). There was no heavy selling, just an interest in helping us fix our problems. This has continued well past implementation” 

Radek Kaczynski, Founder, Bouncer 

A smooth implementation quickly followed: 

> It was just all so seamless, I really don’t have anything to say in particular about it. The team was great and they got it done, quick. I don’t remember much else which is definitely a good thing”

Radek Kaczynski, Founder, Bouncer 

## The results

### **5X revenue growth** since implementation

The company has grown dramatically from processing approximately 150-200 monthly transactions to handling nearly 1,000 transactions per month. 

This transaction growth mirrors their self-service customer revenue, which has also expanded approximately 5X since implementing Paddle, without a corresponding increase in financial operational headcount.

The checkout experience has improved as well, with Paddle's optimized process delivering better conversion rates. 

This frictionless purchasing experience combined with support for local currencies has enhanced customer experience in international markets, particularly in South America where payment preferences differ significantly from North America and Europe.

### **Reduced chargebacks and improved fraud prevention**

As a [Merchant of Record](http://paddle.com/blog/what-is-merchant-of-record) (MoR), Paddle takes primary responsibility for managing fraud and payment disputes, improving Bouncer's cash flow predictability and eliminating time spent contesting chargebacks.

Managing chargebacks previously required Bouncer to divert valuable resources from their core business, investigating disputes, gathering evidence, and submitting documentation.

Each chargeback not only meant lost revenue but also triggered processing fees and countless hours of follow-up. Things are different now:

> It’s definitely noticeable, not having to deal with chargebacks is massive for efficiency and forecasting"

Radek Kaczynski, Founder, Bouncer 

### **Time back for Bouncer**

Instead of managing hundreds of individual customer invoices each month, Bouncer's accounting team now handles just two monthly invoices from Paddle - one for their U.S market and one for the rest of the world. 

This simplification has transformed their financial operations from a paper-heavy manual process to a streamlined system that requires minimal oversight, allowing Bouncer to redirect financial and technical resources toward core product development rather than compliance admin. 

In a similar vein, Paddle's fraud prevention features have decreased chargeback issues, improving both cash flow predictability and reducing the administrative burden of managing payment disputes and fraud threats. 

### **Crucial price agility**

The ability to rapidly test and implement new pricing models has given Bouncer crucial competitive agility in a dynamic market. 

When they needed to adjust their pricing approach for their Bouncer Shield product, they were able to complete the entire process, from design to implementation, in just one week.

> Before Paddle, changing the pricing models took us a ridiculously long time. Now we’re able to make changes in weeks.” 

Radek Kaczynski, Founder, Bouncer.

This agility stands in stark contrast to companies with in-house payment infrastructure, where pricing changes can take months or even a full year to implement due to technical complexity and resource constraints.

For Bouncer, this flexibility enables continuous experimentation and optimization of their business model without the technical constraints that typically limit SaaS pricing innovation.

### **Crucial price flexibility**

Bouncer strongly believes in aligning pricing with actual value delivery. 

Their customer-centric approach explicitly avoids what Radek calls "ghost subscriptions" - situations where customers continue paying without actively using or receiving value from the service.

> I really hate ghost subscriptions, I hate when the customer is not taking the value but still paying for it. It was really important that our payment solution could create a model that would prevent this.” 

Radek Kaczynski, Founder, Bouncer 

Through Paddle, Bouncer was able to implement a pricing system based primarily on usage (credits for verifications), ensuring customers only pay for the value they receive. 

The implementation with Paddle allowed Bouncer to offer multiple automatic purchasing options:

  1. **Monthly scheduled top-ups** for customers with predictable usage patterns
  2. **Emergency automatic top-ups** that trigger when credit balances fall below certain thresholds
  3. **Traditional one-time purchases** for customers who prefer manual control


> Since the flexibility of our integration with Paddle, we were able to do it like that actually, you know, switching the pricing models took us a week, which is amazing, right?” 

Radek Kaczynski, Founder, Bouncer.

## The future 

With Paddle handling all aspects of payments, Bouncer can now focus entirely on advancing their core technology and expanding their product offerings. 

The company continues to enhance their industry-leading email verification engine while developing innovative new solutions like Bouncer Shield, an anti-abuse platform that represents their expansion beyond basic verification into more sophisticated email security.

Looking ahead, Bouncer values having Paddle as their payment partner that can roll with whatever changes come their way. 

As they continue to grow and try out new ideas, they don't have to worry about whether their payment system can keep up… It just works and it will continue to work as Bouncer scale.
