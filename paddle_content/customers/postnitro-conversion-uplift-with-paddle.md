## **The company**

[PostNitro](https://postnitro.ai/) is an AI startup helping entrepreneurs, influencers and agencies grow faster on social media. 

Starting life as a Twitter engagement tool, high third party fees and general instability on the platform caused co-founders, Muneeb Awan and Seerat Awan, to rethink their proposition. 

Noticing the weight social platforms were now placing on carousel posts, the pair created an AI-powered carousel generator to create engaging social media posts efficiently.

PostNitro allows users to create custom carousels in seconds, by incorporating an AI text generator and a no-code design tool. 

## **The challenge**

With such a great product, it was only a matter of time before PostNitro would encounter the challenges of serving a global audience.

> As we grew we quickly realized each country had their own set of policies related to subscriptions and online services, there was no way we could handle the complexity alone.”

Muneeb Awan, Co-founder, PostNitro

Having already used a Merchant of Record (MoR) solution in a previous role, Muneeb knew this would be the best option for PostNitro to sell globally. 

A MoR is a legal entity responsible for selling goods or services to an end customer. They manage all payments and take on the associated liabilities, such as collecting sales tax, ensuring Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, and honoring refunds and chargebacks.

After seeing several influencers promoting Lemon Squeezy, the PostNitro team settled on the platform as their MoR.

Shortly after implementation, however, it became clear that it wasn’t the platform for global growth the team had hoped it would be. 

> 70% of our customers come from outside of the US, Lemon Squeezy only offers payment in dollars, this was a big problem for us.” 

Muneeb Awan, Co-founder, PostNitro

This inability to localize pricing and currencies was soon compounded with another issue. 

During an active marketing campaign running warm leads to a conversion page, a Lemon Squeezy checkout box glitch caused huge amounts of drop-off, resulting in lost revenue. 

> We’ll never know how much revenue we actually lost. I was only made aware of the issue when a customer reached out to me on X (formerly Twitter). That was the final straw.”

Muneeb Awan, Co-founder, PostNitro

PostNitro continued to lose revenue and customers. This issue was paired with sporadic payouts, derailing any predictable growth ambitions the company had. 

The team knew it was time to look for a new MoR. 

## **The solution**

PostNitro needed a new payment partner who could: 

  1. Offer simple, self-serve implementation.
  2. Ensure compliance and help PostNitro sell globally.
  3. Allow for currency and payment localization.


With a full suite of localization tools, including the ability to easily offer local payment methods and currencies, as well as a straightforward self-serve implementation process, Paddle was the only logical choice. 

> The self-serve implementation was easy. Getting our heads around webhooks was really simple too, the dev docs were a massive help!”

## **The results**

### **3x conversions compared to Lemon Squeezy**

Soon after implementation, the PostNitro team saw significant results. 

> We’ve only been running Paddle for a couple of weeks and we’ve already tripled our conversions.”

Muneeb Awan, Co-founder, PostNitro

With so many PostNitro customers located outside of the US, the ability to offer customers local payment methods and currencies through Paddle is one of the reasons they’ve experienced such a great uplift. 

### **9 additional currencies enabled immediately**

With Paddle, you can sell in over 25 different currencies with no additional setup needed. So far, PostNitro is seeing customers purchasing in 10 currencies, rather than only being able to offer USD before. 

These include: Pound Sterling, Euro, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, New Zealand Dollar, Swiss Franc, Danish Krone, Thai Baht and Brazilian Real. 

According to Paddle data on the importance of pricing localization, companies offering two currencies grow 12.7% faster than those with only one. Companies offering 25+ currencies see 24.8% higher growth. 

### Greater visibility of revenue performance 

Gaining a precise and actionable report of your revenue is essential for growth. This is particularly important for SaaS businesses like PostNitro who want to know who’s churning, their location and their customer's lifetime value. 

This data should be easily digestible and accessible too and that's exactly what [ProftitWell Metrics](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics) offers, Paddle's free subscription analytics tool for real-time revenue reporting. 

> Metrics has been great for us. We’ve trialed a lot of other tools and we’ve not been able to find anything that can accurately measure and track MRR, churn and other subscription KPIs like Paddle can.”

Muneeb Awan, Co-founder, PostNitro

## **The future**

Having only recently migrated to Paddle, the best is likely still to come. 

As a member of the[ 2024 AI Launchpad cohort](https://www.paddle.com/ai-launchpad), the PostNitro team will have access to industry-leading mentorship, masterclasses on go-to-market strategy and access the the AI cohort community. All of which are likely to help them achieve their huge growth ambitions for 2025. 

The team is also eager to see how the dunning capabilities within [Paddle Retain](https://www.paddle.com/retain) will help fuel this success too: 

> We had to look at building some of our own custom dunning tools because those offered by Lemon Squeezy were fairly limited. I think these will become obsolete when we start using Retain.”

Muneeb Awan, Co-founder, PostNitro

Having been blown away by the customer portal, the PostNitro team are also excited to see how this already great feature will develop:

> The customer portal is the best thing about Paddle, because it takes the entire process of managing subscriptions off our hands allowing my team to spend time on what actually matters."

Muneeb Awan, Co-founder, PostNitro

In choosing Paddle, PostNitro found a platform that goes far beyond simply managing tax and compliance. They’ve found a payment partner who will help them scale and ensure sustainable global success well into the future.
