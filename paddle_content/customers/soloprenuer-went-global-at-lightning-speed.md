## **The company**

[Unicorn Platform](https://unicornplatform.com/) is a user-friendly website builder founded in 2018 by Alexander Isora, a solo, bootstrapped entrepreneur. The platform allows users to easily create websites for their businesses, books, podcasts, and other projects without requiring technical expertise. 

Alexander has since expanded his projects to include multiple ventures, including Parkasio, a video generator tool, and an upcoming educational course.

> I'm a bootstrapped sole founder. I make startups, but I do it all alone. I don't have a team, financial advisor, or technician. I handle everything myself.” 

Alexander Isora, founder, Unicorn Platform

Alexander (who is based in the country of Georgia) faced a critical obstacle when launching his business: he was unable to use Stripe, due to geographic restrictions. This challenge is surprisingly widespread. According to Alexander's research, approximately 2.5 billion people worldwide are prevented from using Stripe due to regional limitations. 

This creates a substantial barrier for indie developers and entrepreneurs in these regions who want to monetize their software products.

> I felt like I was not allowed to have access to this globally adopted service. And I'm not alone, there are millions of similar people.”

Alexander Isora, founder, Unicorn Platform

As a solo founder, Alexander needed to find a payment solution that was accessible to him and:

  * Required minimal management and oversight from him.
  * Provided reliable, uninterrupted payment management.
  * Offered simple implementation. `


## **The solution**

After discovering that Stripe wasn't an option, Alexander found Paddle. 

Paddle's status as a Merchant of Record (MoR) meant it could manage global payments while taking on the responsibility and liability for sales tax compliance worldwide.

> When I discovered Paddle and installed it and actually used it, I felt that Paddle was my best friend. It gave me hope that I still can be a part of this global movement of startup founders.”

Alexander Isora, founder, Unicorn Platform

The implementation was straightforward, taking only "a couple of days" to complete. Alexander particularly appreciated Paddle's clear documentation: 

> It was super simple, much simpler than Stripe documents... Paddle has exactly what you need."

## **The Results**

### **Uninterrupted payments**

The most valuable outcome has been Paddle's reliability. Unlike peers who experienced account restrictions with other payment solutions, Alexander has enjoyed continuous service since 2018.

> I'm interested in just one thing – stability. I want to trust my payment service. It shouldn't block my accounts for no reason. This has never happened to me with Paddle, because they are super loyal to their clients."

Alexander Isora, founder, Unicorn Platform

### **Successful business exit**

Alexander was able to successfully sell one of his SaaS businesses that was using Paddle, demonstrating that the payment infrastructure supported not only ongoing operations but also business transitions.

### **Focus on core business**

By offloading payment operations to Paddle, Alexander can concentrate on product development and growth – crucial for a solo entrepreneur managing multiple projects simultaneously.

### Multiple successful ventures

Following his successful exit, Alexander launched a new SaaS using Paddle: [Paracast.io](http://paracast.io), which is already generating revenue. His upcoming educational course (you can buy it here [mrr.guide](https://www.mrr.guide/)) is also using Paddle for one-time payments.

> I want to delegate everything about payments to a service and forget about it. Paddle gives me a button to put on my website, and then says, 'good luck with your business' – this is everything I need.”

Alexander Isora, founder, Unicorn Platform

## **The future**

Alexander continues to develop new SaaS products with Paddle as his exclusive payments partner. 

For indie makers like Alexander, particularly those in certain regions, having a reliable payments partner can be the difference between success and failure. Paddle has provided Alexander with the stability to build, grow, and exit and given him peace of mind while managing multiple ventures.
