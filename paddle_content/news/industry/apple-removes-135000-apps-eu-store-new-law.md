Apple has reportedly removed over 137,000 apps from its App Store across European Union member states, as it moves to comply with the [Digital Services Act](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en), which mandates that organizations provide "trader" information.

**New law takes effect:** The DSA, effective since February 17, 2025, requires online platforms to collect and display verified contact details of businesses offering digital services. The aim is to ensure transparency and accountability, allowing consumers to easily identify and contact service providers.

**Six-figure purge:** According to data from [Appfigures](https://appfigures.com/), as [reported by TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/apple-purges-apps-without-contact-info-from-eu-app-store-as-dsa-deadline-hits/), the purge has seen more than 137,000 apps removed from EU App Stores making it the largest mass app removal in the platform's history. The [affected apps](https://www.paddle.com/news/industry/epic-games-expands-mobile-store-third-party) will remain unavailable in the EU until developers provide and verify their trader information through Apple's App Store Connect platform.

**Previous warning:** Apple had previously warned developers they needed to submit their trader status information by the deadline, and that non-compliance would result in the removal of their apps from the EU App Store.
