The popularity of Buy Now, Pay Later financial services over traditional credit cards continues to surge, especially among younger consumers and during the holiday season, according to a new study.

**Millennials, Gen Z love BNPL:** Consumer insights firm J.D. Power's [2025 U.S. Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-buy-now-pay-later-satisfaction-study), which polled around 4,300 U.S. consumers, found BNPL usage has increased significantly, particularly among Millennials and Generation Z. Approximately 42% of consumers in these demographics have used BNPL services, compared to just 21% of older generations.

**Flexibility appeals:** During the 2024 holiday season, Gen Z consumers reported using BNPL services more frequently than traditional credit cards. Key factors driving this adoption include [competitive repayment terms](https://www.paddle.com/billing/payments), seamless integration at checkout, and cost-efficient alternatives to traditional credit lines. Younger consumers are increasingly drawn to BNPL as a [flexible financial tool](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/ca/credit-cards/bnpl-vs-credit-cards/), particularly for managing short-term expenses.

**Big names deliver satisfaction:** The study also ranked customer satisfaction among [BNPL providers](https://www.wsj.com/finance/short-term-loans-get-just-what-they-need-a-long-term-commitment-fa8977ec), with card-linked BNPL products from established financial institutions outperforming standalone BNPL services. The top-ranked BNPL provider was Plan It by American Express (with the highest customer satisfaction score of 706), followed by Chase BNPL, and Citi Flex Pay.

**Brand awareness pays off:** "The BNPL segment has undoubtedly grown in popularity, with more customers using these services than ever before," said Sean Gelles, senior director of banking and payments at J.D. Power. "Card-based BNPL products continue to lead the charge on satisfaction, as issuers are leveraging their existing brand awareness and equity to retain would-be defectors."
