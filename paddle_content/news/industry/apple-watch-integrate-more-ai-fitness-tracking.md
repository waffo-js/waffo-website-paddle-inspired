[A decade](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a62443901/apple-watch-history/) after introducing the Apple Watch, Apple plans to incorporate more AI into the device and its marquee app, Apple Fitness, as it continues to enhance the way users monitor their health and reach their fitness goals.

**More AI on your wrist:** With [AI-driven technology](https://www.paddle.com/news/industry/apple-launch-ai-review-summaries-app-store) playing [an increasing role](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/news-and-stories/stories/ai-revolutioniztes-fitness-tracking.html) in health and fitness—for everyone from elite athletes to casual exercisers—Apple sees even greater potential for Apple Watch and Fitness+, the premium subscription-based extension of Apple Fitness, in the coming years.

**Intelligent motivation:** In an [interview with](https://www.t3.com/active/a-decade-of-apple-fitness-with-jay-blahnik-were-excited-about-ais-role-in-health-and-fitness) [T3.com](http://T3.com), Jay Blahnik, Apple's Vice President of Fitness Technologies, said AI is already influencing key features of the watch, including adaptive goal setting, suggested workouts based on historical data, and reminders to diversify training routines – all aimed to make workouts feel both intuitive and rewarding.

"We're excited about AI and Apple Intelligence's role in shaping fitness," Blahnik said. "Small, intelligent nudges – like realistic activity goals or personalized workout recommendations – can have a massive impact on motivation."

**Popular features:** Several factors have helped cement Apple Watch's status as the world's [most popular smartwatch](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-retains-lead-global-smartwatch-115728083.html), including its appeal not just for elite athletes but also for individuals seeking meaningful lifestyle changes. Its role as both a fitness guide and a health guardian, incorporating features like fall detection, emergency SOS, and ECG monitoring, has also added to its popularity.

**Something for everyone:** A recent addition has been Training Load, introduced with the WatchOS 11 update. While initially seen as a tool for performance athletes, its utility extends to all users. "We built it in a way that helps both seasoned athletes and everyday users. Even if you're not training for a marathon, seeing your load over time helps you understand your activity balance," Blahnik told T3.com.

Other new enhancements include customization within Activity Rings, allowing users to adjust daily goals based on their lifestyle. "Some days are busier than others – Saturday might be more active than Thursday. We wanted to reflect that reality," Blahnik said.
