Automation and [AI overload](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/30/11x-ai-a-developer-of-ai-sales-reps-has-raised-50m-series-b-led-by-a16z-sources-say/) across all stages of the buyer journey threaten authenticity, and slow down real human-to-human connection. Most traditional GTM methods are dead or dying, with outbound growing increasingly saturated and [tough to break through](https://www.paddle.com/news/industry/michael-benson-on-the-smartlead-mailreef-partnership).

Speed has emerged as the ultimate make-or-break criterion for sales and marketing teams needing to work together to convert potential prospects into leads, yet most teams remain stuck when trying to [capture conversations](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/five-ways-b2b-sales-leaders-can-win-with-tech-and-ai) before opportunities are lost. Buyers want what they want _now_ , and attention spans are short. Teams are looking toward [creative AI tools](https://www.paddle.com/news/industry/the-future-of-ai-website-interactions-hao-sheng-ceo-chatsimple) to [break down barriers](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/ai-for-sales-and-marketing-market-45678598.html) and crush their ROI goals.

**Authenticity and momentum:**[Chris Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-miller-435aa3100/), Head of Demand Generation at [Warmly](https://warmly.ai/), explains the company's tech is helping teams gain momentum: "We see ourselves as bridging the gap between the authenticity of human outreach and the speed of automation. The more you can automate, the more you can have humans focus on what they do best, building relationships and thinking strategically."

Warmly lets companies identify warm leads by de-anonymizing people and companies visiting sites. Companies can communicate with visitors immediately as they're visiting and researching company pages, meaning [opportunities are less likely to be missed](https://warmly.ai/p/video-for-shows/20-000-closed-in-the-first-week-of-using-warmly---paul-russo-chief-of-staff-at-pump-co).

**Need for speed:** According to Miller, timing is the critical factor that outreach hinges on. "Speed is just as important as the message. Maximizing the [impact of your message](https://www.paddle.com/news/industry/keeping-up-with-ai-behdad-ebadifar-kong) comes from optimizing what you say, and when you say it. That's why Warmly's [signal monitoring](https://www.warmly.ai/p/product/intent-signals/social-signal-monitoring), de-anonymization, and orchestrations all happen in real time" he notes, emphasizing the narrow window teams have to capitalize on buying signals.

> Your highest intent leads are always going to be on your website. With signal-based selling, you're using Warmly to monitor the buying signals of your best prospects and it notifies you when those prospects are ready to buy.

**Signal-based selling:** Rather than focusing exclusively on specific industries, Warmly targets companies with established [go-to-market processes](https://business.columbia.edu/insights/ai-automation-transforming-go-to-market-strategies) looking to scale quickly. Their platform enables two core strategies: person-based marketing and signal-based selling.

"Your highest intent leads are always going to be on your website," Miller points out. "With signal-based selling, you're using Warmly to monitor the buying signals of your best prospects and it notifies you when those prospects are ready to buy."

The platform's contact-level identification allows marketing teams to build hyper-targeted lists of individuals rather than just accounts. Miller highlights their competitive edge: "We differentiate ourselves now by the quality and real-time nature of signals and data. We have the industry's best de-anonymization data for both individual contacts and accounts."

**Expansion:** Following a recent funding round, Warmly plans to double its European headcount and grow their US-based teams. Miller reveals ambitious plans for the platform's evolution: "As we move into the future, Warmly will be a platform of [AI Marketing Agents](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/aligning-ai-agents-with-marketing-automation-technology/) that will enable marketing teams to massively up-level their output and effectiveness."

This vision includes AI agents that proactively identify best-fit customers, monitor buying signals, and [deliver targeted messaging](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ai-for-sales-and-marketing-market-worth-240-58-billion-by-2030---exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets-302385672.html) across appropriate channels. The system will feature a feedback loop for self-improvement while maintaining a hybrid approach where users can co-pilot and train the AI on specific go-to-market strategies.
