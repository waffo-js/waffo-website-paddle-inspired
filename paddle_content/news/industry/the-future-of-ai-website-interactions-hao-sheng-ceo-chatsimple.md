> Websites are like Yahoo in the early 2000s. Most sites are like a big catalog of things to browse – they provide hundreds of blogs and thousands of pages, but what a visitor actually needs is just a small part of what’s there.

Long overlooked and forgotten in favor of paid channels and off-site traffic generation, businesses' websites have gathered dust, begging for revitalization. Most business sites remain outdated in how they present information, leaving site visitors to navigate a maze just to find what they need. The disconnect leaves both customers and businesses in the dark—customers struggle to get answers, and businesses miss opportunities to understand and [serve their audience effectively](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/02/20/ai-powered-customer-service-a-new-era/).

It’s a growing problem that became an "obsession" for [Hao Sheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hao-sheng/), CEO & Co-Founder of [Chatsimple](https://www.chatsimple.ai/) – an AI agent for inbound sales and support that transforms websites into pipeline generation machines. Determined to bridge this gap, Sheng and his team are laser-focused on refining the online experience, bringing it in [line with the future](https://www.nfx.com/post/ai-agent-marketplaces) while much of the internet remains stuck in the past.

**Stuck in the 2000s:** "Websites are like Yahoo in the early 2000s," Sheng says. "Most sites are like a big catalog of things to browse – they provide hundreds of blogs and thousands of pages, but what a visitor actually needs is just a small part of what’s there."

"Everyone who comes to your website has a purpose, [especially in B2B](https://www.paddle.com/news/industry/docketai-approach-to-ai-sales-enablement-bassam-aoun). They're not there for window shopping. They have a question, they need an answer, they need a solution," says Sheng.

But most modern-day websites are outdated. To counter a painful experience for site visitors, Chatsimple's AI interface lets visitors find information in the most effective way possible and creates a clean framework for businesses to follow up, provide customer support, and ultimately close deals.

> Most customer-to-business communication will eventually become customer-to-AI communication.

**Measuring ROI in real terms:** "The biggest part of how we help businesses is by measuring their ROI—how many leads were collected, how many meetings were booked through Chatsimple’s widget, and how many more sales are being converted in pipelines," Sheng says. Across thousands of business websites paying for Chatsimple, customers typically see 50% more, to even three times more leads or meetings booked.

**A frictionless future:** As many businesses are still trapped in letting customers lapse as they get lost [finding customer service help](https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/future-of-customer-service-training-prepare-agents-for-ai-driven-work/), Chatsimple’s mission is to think bigger and [optimize for customer experience](https://www.paddle.com/news/industry/innovative-sales-engagement-to-combat-ai-nick-telson-sillett-trumpet) and [increased conversion rates](https://www.paddle.com/solutions/self-serve). "Our focus is on the interface," Sheng says. "We’re building the best AI-powered interface for humans to communicate with businesses."

**Communication revolution:** "Traditionally, businesses rely on human teams for sales and customer support, but [AI is available 24/7](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aytekintank/2025/02/18/6-ways-ai-agents-can-help-you-accomplish-hours-of-work-in-minutes/) at a fraction of the cost and can have [extensive knowledge about your business](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2025/02/11/ai-agents-are-coming-for-your-industry-heres-whos-first-in-line/)," Sheng explains. Chatsimple doesn’t just increase lead generation—it reduces the need for overall human involvement.

Sheng believes AI will revolutionize customer interactions. "AI remembers every interaction, unlike human reps where you may have to explain your situation over and over to multiple people," he says. "Imagine dealing with a single [AI that understands your needs](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250225253792/en/Millennials-Lead-in-AI-Comfort-and-Trust-While-Gen-Z-Emerges-as-Key-Audience-for-AI-Driven-PC-Insurance-Solutions-Insurity-Survey-Finds) instantly—that’s the future." For Sheng, this shift isn’t just a possibility—it’s an inevitability. "Most customer-to-business communication will eventually become customer-to-AI communication," he predicts.
