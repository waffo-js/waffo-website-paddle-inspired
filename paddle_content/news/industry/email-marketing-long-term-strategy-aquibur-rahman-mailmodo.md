Forget short-term hacks and cold blasts. While others chase clicks, smart marketers treat email as a long game—building trust, delivering value, and compounding results over time.

[Aquibur Rahman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aquibur/) is the Founder of [Mailmodo](https://www.mailmodo.com/), an email marketing platform built around interactivity and automation. He’s focused on turning email from a short-term tactic into a long-term growth engine.

**Play the long game:** Email works, but only when it’s built to last. 

"A lot of marketers and business people in general try to use email to achieve short-term gain," says Rahman. Cold email gets a bad rap, but the issue isn’t email marketing—it’s the horizon. "In the long term, cold email was never going to work."

The real opportunity isn’t in volume. It’s in consistency. 

"[Email is a great channel to nurture customers](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1211452/automated-email-marketing-conversion-rates-worldwide/), to educate them, and bring them to a decision-making point," he says. The brands that win don’t blast—they build.

**Own it:** With ads and social, reach is rented. But email? That’s yours. 

"Email is the only channel where you own the audience data," says Rahman. "In other channels—Facebook, Google Ads, etc.—the audience isn’t yours."

That ownership isn’t just a data advantage, it’s a financial one. 

"You can keep nurturing them again and again without breaking the bank," Rahman explains. When platforms change and [ad prices spike](https://searchengineland.com/digital-ad-prices-rise-channels-performance-steady-444590), email stays steady.

> I believe that marketing is about two things: grabbing attention and building trust. AI can help you a lot in improving the efficiency of your work as a marketer.

**No gimmicks:** Getting into the inbox is about trust, not tricks. Deliverability comes down to a few key factors. "Number one is that users trust the brand," says Rahman. "Second is historical engagement."

And when it comes to content, cheap tactics won’t cut it. 

"If every email says 50% discount, seven days to go, etc., then you will start [landing into spam](https://www.statista.com/statistics/420400/spam-email-traffic-share-annual/) very soon." The real driver is relevance. "You need to give them relevant, personalized content that provides value," he says.

**Multiply what matters:** AI adds force to what already works—it’s not a shortcut, it’s a multiplier. 

"AI helps to produce better branded content that builds trust and provides value to customers in a repeatable fashion," says Rahman. "It should be used to improve systems and processes."

For Rahman, the real win is in doing better work, faster.
