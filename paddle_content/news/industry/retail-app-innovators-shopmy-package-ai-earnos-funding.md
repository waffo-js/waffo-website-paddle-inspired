Retail innovation is at an all-time high, with [new models](https://www.paddle.com/news/industry/kamal-nahas-pap-helping-consumers-find-lost-money-inbox) and modern [AI-based updates to legacy models](https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/videos/nice-vp-talks-ais-role-in-the-sales-conversion-spectrum-eliminating-friction-points/) driving better consumer experiences across all platforms. Here's a look at some of the most exciting app and web app-based companies that just raised big funding rounds to continue growing and evolving the market.

**$77.5M for creator-led marketing:**[ShopMy](https://shopmy.us/blog/post/shopmy-raises-$77.5m-to-pioneer-performance-first-approach) is a creator-driven marketing platform that allows influencers to curate digital shops and enable their audience to shop product recommendations. The company works both sides of the marketplace by also allowing its creators to foster partnerships with the massive brands, manage paid collaborations, chat directly in-platform, and expand monetization opportunities.

**$14M for last-mile CX** : [Package.ai](http://Package.ai) is an AI-driven platform focused on customer engagement and last-mile logistics for big-box retailers. The company got its start with furniture and appliance retailers, helping them transition from outdated, siloed systems to a unified platform. Its platform powers retailers to deliver personalized experiences that rival those of Amazon and Uber.

**Moving away from ads:**[EarnOS](https://www.earnos.com/) announced it raised $5 million in funding to accelerate its mission to minimize intrusive mobile ads, and instead incentivize consumers who complete engaging brand campaigns with a stablecoin rewards incentive system. The app uses AI-based semantic analysis to "understand" consumers and enables big brands to reach the right people while empowering users to discover more of what they love while getting rewarded.
