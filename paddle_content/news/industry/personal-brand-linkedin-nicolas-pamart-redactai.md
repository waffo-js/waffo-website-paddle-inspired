Content may be king, but most people are still grappling with ways to be seen and heard on oversaturated social media platforms. [LinkedIn](https://www.inc.com/shira-lazar/3-reasons-linkedin-will-be-the-social-platform-of-2025/91144764), however, has shown [promise as the ideal space](https://www.adweek.com/media/linkedin-pitches-creators-with-new-tools/) for building a personal brand and fostering professional connections. But thought leadership hopefuls wonder how in a sea of noise, they can actually stand out.

We spoke with [Nicolas Pamart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pamartn/), CEO and Solopreneur of [RedactAI](https://redactai.io/), an AI solution for creating Linkedin posts, to [discuss strategies for LinkedIn success](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesagencycouncil/2024/07/18/why-you-shouldnt-overlook-linkedin-influencer-marketing-anymore/) and how his company is helping people scale their content efforts effectively.

**Finding resonance:** According to Pamart, understanding your goal on LinkedIn is the unmissable first step before diving into content creation. "You have multiple paths to choose from," Parmart says. "Some people post only tips and value-driven content. While that’s good, it won’t help you build your personal brand. You can share tips, but if you don’t add a personal touch, no one will truly resonate with you."

**Networking opportunities:** If you aim to grow your network, Pamart advises sharing content that resonates with your interests, engaging with like-minded individuals, and sparking conversations. For example, Pamart, a SaaS founder, shares his thoughts on SaaS, not to sell a product, but to connect with others in the industry. "When I post about SaaS, I don’t expect to sell anything directly, but I attract people who share similar interests. We discuss ideas, debate in the comment section, and [ultimately, my network grows](https://fortune.com/2025/03/16/25-year-old-entrepreneur-linkedin-content-creation-tiktok-instagram/)."

**Content at scale:** To streamline this process, RedactAI helps individuals create tailored LinkedIn posts in a fraction of the time. By analyzing a user’s profile and previous content, the platform generates posts that match their unique writing style and message. "You just come with an idea, and within 30 seconds, you have a post ready," says Pamart. The ability to quickly produce content that is both original and aligned with your brand is RedactAI’s differentiation point.

> Even if you draw inspiration from other successful posts, it’s your own ideas that will make the difference.

**The B2B social network:** LinkedIn’s distinct advantage over other platforms lies in its B2B focus. As Pamart points out, "LinkedIn is where you can do the most business compared to other networks. [It’s a powerful tool for B2B communication](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/linkedin-study-ai-shortens-b2b-sales-cycles-by-1-week/542323/)." Even if you're in a B2C market, the networking benefits of LinkedIn should not be overlooked. The more genuine, original content you share, the more likely you are to build connections that can lead to opportunities down the road.

**No evergreen options:** Consistency is another crucial factor in gaining traction on the platform. "You have to post a lot," says Pamart. "It’s not like blogging where you create evergreen content. On LinkedIn, you need to post every day. And yes, sometimes it means repeating the same ideas." Repetition is key for visibility, Pamart argues, as the more frequently your ideas are seen, the more likely they are to resonate with your audience.

**Sharing your own ideas:** While some may argue that LinkedIn content feels repetitive, Pamart emphasizes that originality is still possible. "Even if you draw inspiration from other successful posts, it’s your own ideas that will make the difference." By [using AI tools](https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/2025/03/linkedin-post-generator-ai-a-boon-or-a-threat-to-content-creation/) to fine-tune your content and stay consistent, you can build a presence that not only attracts connections but also cultivates meaningful relationships.
