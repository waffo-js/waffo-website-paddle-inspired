After a recent string of high-profile suits and hefty fines against [Capital One](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2025/01/cfpb-sues-capital-one-alleging-the-bank-misled-consumers-about-its-360-savings-accounts/), [Block](https://www.financemagnates.com/fintech/cfpb-orders-block-to-pay-255-million-for-compliance-and-fraud-failures/), [Equifax](https://thefintechtimes.com/cfpb-slaps-equifax-with-15million-fine-for-mishandling-consumer-credit-disputes/), and [Cash App](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/01/21/cash-app-block-mobile-banking-security-customer-service-claims-money/77849866007/), the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) finds itself on the defensive against the return of the Trump Administration. The incoming President is focused on cutting red tape wherever possible in the name of free markets, and the Obama-era CFPB is a likely target.

**The background:** The bureau was formed as part of the larger [Dodd-Frank](https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/index.htm) consumer protections initiative in 2011, and was tasked with enforcing laws for financial products. Since its start, the CFPB has provided over $21 billion in consumer returns by tackling issues like junk fees and fraud.

But the bureau has more recently [faced opposition](https://fortune.com/article/future-of-cfpb-in-doubt-under-trump/) from Republican figures and business leaders like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Marc Andreessen, who criticize it for being overly politicized and unaccountable.

**Longstanding feud:** Trump, during his first term, [promised changes](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/24/trump-signs-bank-bill-rolling-back-some-dodd-frank-regulations.html) to the Dodd-Frank Act and the potential elimination of the CFPB. In anticipation of a leadership change with Trump's incoming administration, the Bureau released a report called "[Strengthening State-Level Consumer Protections](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_strengthening-state-level-consumer-protections_2025-01.pdf)" to influence state-level consumer protection laws before a potential shift in federal regulatory policy.

**Impact on fintechs and consumer startups:** The Trump administration is attempting to carefully balance its pro-business stance with promises to help consumers. And while fintechs and consumer startups benefit from moving quickly and freely without slow governmental oversight, they also often fall victim to the whims of Big Tech controlling the distribution and monetization platforms. The bureau was considering more scrutiny into Meta for data handling and [Google's mobile financial transactions](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/head-federal-agency-consumers-packed-office-trump-fire-117998998), meaning regulation and oversight are akin to a food chain, where the largest animal typically wins.
