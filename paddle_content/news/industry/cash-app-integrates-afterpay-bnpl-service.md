With consumer demand for buy now, pay later services increasing, mobile payment and financial services provider Cash App has [integrated Afterpay's BNPL offerings](https://finovate.com/block-rebrands-afterpay-to-cash-app-afterpay/) into its platform, rebranding the service as Cash App Afterpay.

**BNPL's attraction:** The integration allows Cash App's 57 million monthly active users to access flexible payment options directly within the app when shopping online at partner merchant sites. BNPL services have seen increased adoption among consumers facing financial challenges. Research indicates that individuals encountering cash flow issues are [3.5 times more likely](https://www.pymnts.com/study_posts/cash-flow-shortages-drive-consumers-bnpl-usage/) to utilize BNPL options, with 8.9% having used such services in the past 30 days.

**Sold as a win-win:** The collaboration introduces a unified brand identity, featuring a new logo designed to provide a seamless pay-over-time experience. According to Nick Molnar, Global Head of Sales at Block and Co-founder of Afterpay, there are [mutual benefits](https://investors.block.xyz/investor-news/news-details/2025/Cash-App-Begins-Roll-Out-of-Afterpays-Pay-Over-Time-Offering-at-Hundreds-of-Thousands-of-Merchants/default.aspx) arising from the integration: merchants gain access to a broader customer base, while consumers receive accessible payment alternatives outside traditional systems.

**Tapping a lucrative market:** As the BNPL market [continues to expand](https://www.paddle.com/news/industry/bnpl-popularity-over-credit-cards-young-consumers)—with projections it will surpass $160 billion by 2032—the integration positions Cash App to compete more directly with industry players like Klarna, which recently [partnered with Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/klarna-replaces-affirm-as-buy-now-pay-later-provider-at-walmart-11c3b15e) to offer pay-later options via Walmart's OnePay service. Both Cash App and Afterpay have strong appeal among younger users, with Cash App ranked among the top five most authentic brands to Gen Z, and Afterpay recognized as a trusted BNPL provider.
