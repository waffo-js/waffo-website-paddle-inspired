**Fintech's bet big:** The fintech industry is doubling down on advertising, with companies like Brex, Klarna, PayPal, and Mercury leading the charge. Advertising spend soared by 45% over the past three years, according to [Outfront Media](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/outfrontmedia_fintech-ooh-bloomberg-activity-7282861857357328384-hqpK/), particularly in hubs like New York, San Francisco, and London.

After the roller coaster that was 2021-2023, Fintechs are finally exiting an age of austerity. [Rising regulatory scrutiny](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-05/fintechs-ramp-up-advertising-spending-to-appeal-to-wider-market) – particularly around partnerships with banks and transparency in fees – has lingered as an existential threat to growth, but the incoming Trump Administration is easing some fears. Somewhat related, companies are anxiously awaiting the reopening of the M&A and IPO season, as [Klarna's anticipated public offering](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/14/klarna-scores-global-payment-deal-with-stripe-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo.html) could set the stage for others to follow suit.

**Layoffs at Stripe:**[Stripe has laid off 300](https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/stripe-employees-workforce-cuts-additions/737935/) employees across its product, engineering, and operations teams – or roughly 3.5% of its workforce. The move comes as part of what it calls a broader restructuring to optimize talent for growth and ultimately increase headcount in 2025.

**Highnote hits a high note:** The card management platform [Highnote secured a $90 million](https://www.fintechfutures.com/techwire/highnote-secures-90-million-series-b-announces-expansion-into-u-s-merchant-acquiring/) Series B to support its expansion into U.S. merchant acquiring. It now offers full pay-in and pay-out capabilities for enterprises via API-based integrations with major payment networks.
