A new report from [Photoroom](https://www.photoroom.com/) finds that brands investing in fresh, clean, and consistently updated visuals see significantly improved conversions and higher average selling prices.

**Visual difference-makers:** The _[Clothing& apparel product photography trends 2025](https://www.photoroom.com/industry-trends/clothing)_ report is based on a survey of more than 1,000 clothing brands in the U.S. and the U.K. With global e-commerce [projected to surpass $8 trillion](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/27/3015434/28124/en/B2C-E-Commerce-and-Shopper-Insights-Report-2025-2028-Retail-E-Commerce-is-Forecasted-to-Reach-Nearly-8-Trillion-by-2027-Making-Up-Over-20-of-Global-Retail-Sales.html#:~:text=Retail%20E%2DCommerce%20to%20Approach,the%20region's%20total%20retail%20sales.) by 2027 and the clothing and apparel segment expected to exceed US$1.16 trillion by 2030, the new data underscores how professional product images can be the difference between making or missing a sale.

  * Nearly half of the surveyed businesses [refresh product photos](https://www.photoroom.com/industry/clothing-and-apparel) at least every three months—fueled by the increasing ease of AI editing tools like background removal, lighting adjustments, and automated editing.
  * Some sellers cite over 90% reduction in photo-editing costs compared to previous manual methods.
  * Advanced editing APIs are giving even small sellers the opportunity to scale visuals quickly and professionally—an advantage typically reserved for big-budget players.


**Behind the research:** Photoroom, the Paris-based AI photo-editing platform behind [the research](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/photoroom_clothing-photography-and-photo-editing-trends-activity-7308479934547517442-b_Wu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACVHl48BHQ8Fn_HvAqESwo7_KQELx1rJT6s), has seen firsthand how rapidly brands are adopting new tools to keep up. Founded in 2019, Photoroom has grown into a global platform with over 150 million downloads, and raised a [$43 million Series B](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/confirmed-photoroom-the-ai-image-editor-raised-43m-at-a-500m-valuation/) in 2024.

**Consumer expectations:** The stakes are high. According to the report, a staggering 75% of online shoppers rely on product photography when making decisions, and 22% of returns are driven by a garment looking different in person than it did in images. Clothing [brands see missed conversions](https://www.paddle.com/revenuecat-integration-beta), higher return rates, and damage to their reputations when the product imagery doesn’t live up to consumer expectations. More macro, the [growing global trade tension](https://circularcollective.co/manufacturing-supply-chain-and-logistics/joe-lynch-logistics-supply-chain-challenges/) spurred on by the new "reciprocal" tariffs coming from the U.S. will potentially alter consumer spending habits, making affordable optimization more important than ever.
