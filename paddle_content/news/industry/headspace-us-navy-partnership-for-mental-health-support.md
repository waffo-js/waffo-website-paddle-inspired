Wellness app provider [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/), has announced a new [partnership with the U.S. Navy](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/digital-health/headspace-inks-partnership-us-navy-and-explores-conversational-ai-mental-health) to provide 25,000 active duty sailors and their families free access to one-on-one mental health coaching and Headspace's library of wellbeing, mental strength training, and sleep content.

**The battle for wellbeing:** The program is designed to help the sailors and their families take proactive steps to improve their wellbeing and enable them to build skills to better manage their mental health. Those eligible for the Navy's program can access Headspace to seek various types of on-demand support to meet their unique needs.

**A top health concern:** According to a [recent report](https://www.health.mil/News/Articles/2024/12/01/MSMR-Mental-Health-Update-2024) from the Defense Health Agency, mental health disorders were the top reason active duty U.S. military personnel were hospitalized in 2023. With service members continuing to experience increased rates of mental health disorders, the Navy hopes the partnership with Headspace will make it easy to access support at any time and from the privacy of their phones.

**Firsthand experience:** Headspace CEO Tom Pickett, a former naval aviator and F/A-18 fighter pilot, [says in a press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250305527571/en/Headspace-Announces-Partnership-With-the-U.S.-Navy) he knew firsthand the stigma of seeking mental health support while serving on active duty. "Just like physical training strengthens the body, practicing 'mental pushups' — whether it's meditating regularly, texting with a coach when you’re feeling lonely, or building healthy sleep routines — can strengthen the mind over time and have a powerful impact on overall well-being and resilience," he says.
