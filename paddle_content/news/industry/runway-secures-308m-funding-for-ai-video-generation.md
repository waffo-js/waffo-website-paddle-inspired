AI video-generating startup Runway has secured $308 million in a Series D round [led by General Atlantic](https://www.generalatlantic.com/media-article/runway-series-d-funding-towards-a-new-media-ecosystem-with-world-simulators/), with participation from major players like Nvidia and SoftBank. Sources [cited by Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-video-maker-runway-raises-308-million-general-atlantic-led-funding-round-2025-04-03/) suggest the round pushes Runway’s valuation above $3 billion.

Runway specializes in generative AI research that is transforming [multimedia content creation](https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-runway-gen-4) and democratizes access for all. Founded in 2018, Runway develops a suite of tools that enable users to generate and edit videos and images using AI, catering to artists, filmmakers, advertisers, and content creators. The platform is designed to be user-friendly, making advanced AI capabilities accessible to individuals with varying levels of technical filmmaking expertise.

**New media ecosystem:** In announcing the raise, Runway described a “new media ecosystem” centered on “world simulators”—AI that can model and predict events within digital environments. Much of the capital will expand Runway Studios, which develops original film and animation content using foundation models, including the “Gen-4” system, promising consistent video generation.

Runway has raised a cumulative $536.5 million, [according to TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/03/runway-best-known-for-its-video-generating-models-raises-308m/), but faces stiff competition from established players like [OpenAI's Sora](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-31/runway-s-new-ai-tool-challenges-openai-s-sora-with-more-cohesive-videos) and Google. The startup is also navigating a lawsuit from artists who argue that training AI on copyrighted material without permission violates their rights.

**Democratization through credit-based pricing:**[Runway’s tiered, credit-based model](https://runwayml.com/pricing) ranges from a free Basic plan with limited credits, to an Unlimited plan at $76 per user per month. This structure serves both solo creators and large-scale productions seeking substantial AI-generated content. By aligning usage with cost, Runway makes gen AI broadly accessible in an industry that was previously plagued by [exclusion and high barriers of entry](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-impact-of-generative-ai-on-hollywood-and-entertainment/).

**What's next:** Runway says its new funds will fuel further AI research, hiring, and continued refinement of “world simulators.” With global interest in generative media rising, the potential for major shifts in film, advertising, and other digital content remains significant.
