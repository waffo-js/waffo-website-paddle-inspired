Apple is set to introduce [AI-generated review summaries](https://www.theverge.com/news/624891/ai-generated-review-summaries-coming-to-apples-app-store) in the App Store with the release of iOS 18.4, a move designed to give users a quick way to get insights into feedback on apps they're interested in.

**A review of reviews:** Initially launching in the U.S., the feature leverages large language models to analyze and condense user reviews into concise, naturally worded summaries. [Apple's intention](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/whats-new/) is for the AI-generated paragraphs to highlight both positive and negative aspects of an app, offering prospective users a balanced view without requiring them to sift through hundreds of individual reviews.

**Mix of views promised:** The company has not disclosed the specific parameters used by its AI models to determine which reviews are emphasized in summaries, but Apple does say its algorithms aim to surface a representative mix of user sentiments, ensuring that summaries do not skew overly positive or negative. The summaries will be updated weekly and will appear on app listing pages for apps with a sufficient number of reviews.

**Expansion on the horizon:** At launch, the feature will be available in English, with Apple planning to expand it to additional languages and regions later in 2025. The initiative follows a broader trend in e-commerce and digital platforms, where AI-generated review highlights have been gaining traction. [Amazon introduced](https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-rolls-out-ai-generated-summaries-of-customer-reviews/) a similar AI-generated review summarization feature in 2023.
