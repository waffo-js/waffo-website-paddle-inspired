CEO | Aptoide

Alternative app store [Aptoide](https://en.aptoide.com/ios) has [officially launched its platform](https://blog.aptoide.com/aptoide-launches-its-first-standalone-ios-store/) for iPhone and iPad users within the European Union. The move follows Apple's recent [policy changes](https://support.apple.com/en-euro/117767) permitting third-party app stores, aligning with the EU's [Digital Markets Act](https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/index_en).

**Moving into iOS World:** Aptoide, which already offers a popular service for the [Android ecosystem](https://en.aptoide.com/), began beta testing the iOS version of its platform in June 2024 and it's now fully accessible to EU users, offering a wide range of gaming apps.

**Version flexibility:** A feature of Aptoide is its "App Versions" functionality, which enables users to download and install previous iterations of games, a plus for users with older Apple models incompatible with the latest software updates, or those who favor earlier versions of specific games.

**Opening up the ecosystem:** "This full launch marks a major milestone in game distribution on iOS and Aptoide’s commitment to an open and unrestricted app distribution ecosystem," Aptoide CEO Paulo Trezentos said in a [press release](https://www.gamespress.com/FIRST-FREE-ALTERNATIVE-APP-STORE-ON-iOS-LAUNCHES-TO-ALL-EU-USERS). "Apple users now have access to newfound freedoms, but there's a huge amount of work still to be done to continue opening up iOS globally and reduce friction for users, and game developers."
