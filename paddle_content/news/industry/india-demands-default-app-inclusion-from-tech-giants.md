 _Developing story,[reported here by Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-23/india-presses-apple-google-to-open-up-to-state-backed-app-store). We have also reached out to Indian app-makers for further context._

**Forced downloads:** India is pushing to gain more control over distribution on smartphones by requesting Apple and Alphabet to allow the government-backed super app [GOV.in](https://apps.mgov.gov.in/) to be available by default in their app stores.

[According to Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-23/india-presses-apple-google-to-open-up-to-state-backed-app-store) reporting, the Indian technology ministry has approached executives from multiple smartphone manufacturers to discuss making the state-backed app suite available in their marketplaces to expand the distribution of public welfare services. The move would likely require pre-installation of the app, and force permitting downloads from third-party sources without warnings.

**Walled gardens:** Both Apple and Google are known for their strict control of their "[walled gardens](https://www.mlex.com/mlex/antitrust/articles/2286654/apple-defends-walled-garden-again-in-trial-of-uk-mass-claim-over-app-store)", and thus resistant to the plan. Failure to comply would likely tee up a legal battle or harsher policy mandates from the Indian government. The country previously enacted measures like [banning TikTok](https://time.com/7208112/what-happened-when-india-banned-tiktok/) and[ challenging Meta](https://cybernews.com/news/meta-india-whatsapp-encryption/) over encrypted messages.

**What we're tracking:** Undeniably, India is one of the top emerging markets for all things tech, and smartphone usage is [growing rapidly](https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/consumer-electronics/telephony/smartphones/india#:~:text=In%202025%2C%20the%20revenue%20in,\(CAGR%202025%2D2029\).). So any challenge could easily upset the government's important growth goals on the consumer technology front.
