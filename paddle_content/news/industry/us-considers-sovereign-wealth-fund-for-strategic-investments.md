The U.S. government is considering [establishing a sovereign wealth fund](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-moves-develop-sovereign-wealth-fund-create-value-american-citize-rcna190484) (SWF) to manage strategic investments, including a [potential acquisition of TikTok](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/03/tech/tiktok-us-sovereign-wealth-fund-trump/index.html), though the plan still faces legislative, financial, and logistical challenges.

**Why it matters:** If it goes ahead, the SWF could significantly impact the domestic venture capital sector by introducing government-backed capital, altering competitive dynamics, and potentially shifting investment priorities toward strategic industries.

**Politics and investment:** The government's role in the SWF may lead to investments driven by policy objectives rather than purely financial returns, [potentially affecting market dynamics](https://www.fletcherforum.org/home/04/02/2024/wealth-beyond-borders-the-unfolding-challenges-for-sovereign-wealth-funds). As has happened [in some countries](https://thediplomat.com/2024/04/how-the-indonesia-investment-authority-built-its-portfolio-in-2023), the SWF might prioritize investments in sectors deemed strategically important, such as technology or infrastructure, potentially guiding the direction of innovation. It’s decisions to make certain large-scale investments could lead to market distortions, affecting the natural flow of private capital and possibly leading to overvaluation in some sectors.
