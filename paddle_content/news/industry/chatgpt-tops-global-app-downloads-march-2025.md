OpenAI's ChatGPT has notched up another milestone as users' interest in generative AI tools continues to blossom. Figures show ChatGPT was the most downloaded mobile app worldwide in March 2025, overtaking long-standing leaders Instagram and TikTok.

**Fresh feature frenzy:** According to data from Appfigures, ChatGPT achieved [46 million downloads](https://appfigures.com/resources/insights/20250404) across iOS and Android platforms, marking a 28% increase from February and a 148% year-over-year surge. [March's surge](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/31/chatgpt-image-altman-openai-users) is attributed to OpenAI's significant feature enhancements, notably the upgraded image-generation capabilities.

**The Ghibli grip:** A new feature that allows users to create visuals in the style of [Studio Ghibli](https://petapixel.com/2025/03/27/people-are-using-chatgpts-new-ai-image-generator-to-turn-photos-into-studio-ghibli-style-images/) quickly went viral, leading to over 700 million images generated by more than 130 million users within a week of its release. Additionally, OpenAI relaxed certain content moderation policies and improved the app's AI voice functionalities, further enhancing user engagement.

**AI wins consumer approval:** While Instagram and TikTok secured the second and third spots with 46 million and 45 million downloads, respectively, ChatGPT's ascent signifies [a broader shift](https://www.askattest.com/blog/articles/2025-consumer-adoption-of-ai-report) in user preferences towards [AI-driven applications](https://www.paddle.com/news/industry/kamal-nahas-pap-helping-consumers-find-lost-money-inbox). The total downloads for the top 10 non-gaming apps reached 339 million in March, indicating robust overall app engagement.

**The bigger picture:** OpenAI's momentum is further evidenced by its rapid user base expansion. As of February 2025, ChatGPT boasted 400 million weekly active users, with ambitions to reach [1 billion by year's end](https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-users-billion-data-centers-chatgpt-2024-12).
