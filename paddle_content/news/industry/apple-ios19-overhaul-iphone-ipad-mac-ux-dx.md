Apple is reportedly preparing to implement one of the most significant software overhauls in its history, aiming to transform the user experience across its iPhone, iPad, and Mac platforms.

**OS overhaul:**[According to Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-16/apple-iphone-17-air-foldable-iphone-details-ai-crisis-to-haunt-top-100-event-m8bl3a9c), the company’s forthcoming operating system updates -iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16 - are set to introduce comprehensive design changes that will fundamentally alter the appearance and functionality of Apple’s OSs. The changes are intended to create a more consistent and familiar experience [across all Apple devices](https://medium.com/%40allygill_73781/the-apple-ecosystem-is-let-down-by-inconsistencies-90d4c4567a84).

**Vision of the future:** The planned redesigns will encompass updates to icons, menus, applications, windows, and system buttons. The changes are reportedly inspired by the design principles of [visionOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisionOS), the software that powers Apple's Vision Pro headset, and will incorporate greater transparency alongside new types of windows and buttons.

**Big reveal at WWDC:** Apple is believed to be planning to unveil these updates at its annual [Worldwide Developers Conference](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/) (WWDC) in June 2025. The company is said to be confident that users will embrace the new look and feel, aiming to appeal to both its extensive existing user base and potential new customers.
