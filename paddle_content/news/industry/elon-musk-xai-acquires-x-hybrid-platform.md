Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company [xAI has officially acquired X](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/28/elon-musk-says-xai-acquired-x/) (formerly Twitter) in an all-stock deal that creates a new type of hybrid platform—one that blurs the lines between social interaction, data infrastructure, AI, and digital commerce.

**Powerful combination:** The merged entity, valued at $113 billion, combines xAI's cutting-edge language models with X’s large user base, now over 600 million monthly active users. Musk [framed the acquisition](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1905731750275510312) as a logical next step, posting: "xAI and X's futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution, and talent."

**Social and tech collide:** The newly formed xAI Holdings Corp is now positioned as both a consumer platform and a tech infrastructure provider. Analysts expect the merged entity to [accelerate development](https://www.kaupr.io/en-us/news/is-elon-musks-x-payments-payment-solution-taking-shape) in verticalized AI applications—particularly around messaging, commerce, and payments—potentially challenging legacy players and reshaping how value moves through digital platforms.

**'Everything app' inches closer:** Since Musk [acquired Twitter in 2022](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter) for $44 billion and rebranded it as X, the platform has evolved beyond traditional social media. X is now positioning itself as an [everything app](https://thisweekinproducts.substack.com/p/elon-musks-everything-app-and-metas), with payments, creator monetization tools, and digital identity functionality already in development. With the integration of xAI, that vision moves closer to reality.

**The growth of Grok:** xAI, founded in 2023, has rapidly scaled to become a major player in the generative AI space. Its flagship product [Grok](https://cryptoslate.com/elon-musk-launches-ai-chatbot-grok-on-telegram-as-platform-hits-1-billion-users/) is already embedded in the X platform and is designed to operate as a real-time conversational assistant. For developers, this opens new possibilities around API integration, AI-native workflows, and smarter interfaces.
