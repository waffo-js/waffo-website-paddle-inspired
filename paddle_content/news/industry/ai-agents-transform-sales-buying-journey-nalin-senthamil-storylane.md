AI is no longer just an abstract concept—it’s here, [reshaping how businesses work](https://www.paddle.com/news/industry/overcoming-app-challenges-with-web2app-monetization-lea-samrani-passion-io) and connect with customers. In sales and marketing, it’s not just another tool—it’s a game-changer.

[Nalin Senthamil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nalinpradeep/), Founder and CEO of [Storylane](https://www.storylane.io/), is among those putting AI into action: rewriting the sales playbook with agentic demo automation that makes buying seamless and storytelling smarter.

**Level up:** "The reality is AI is upskilling everybody," Senthamil says. And that shift isn't just about marketers getting sharper. AI is redefining the way marketing connects with sales, product, and customer success—replacing rigid boundaries with smarter, more integrated collaboration.

**Kill the friction:** Storylane's mission is simple: "to remove the friction in the whole buying journey," Senthamil explains. Today's buyers want control. [They're doing their homework](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbescommunicationscouncil/2024/04/26/the-new-buyers-journey-how-to-win-over-informed-b2b-customers/) and want product clarity without jumping on a sales call.

Sales teams are most effective when they're helping buyers traverse the "last mile" of that journey. "Buyers want to understand how the product works and how it will work for their specific use case," he says. With the right [AI agents](https://www.paddle.com/news/industry/docketai-approach-to-ai-sales-enablement-bassam-aoun) in place, buyers can get that clarity instantly. No need for early discovery calls just to see if the product even fits.

> Think of these AI agents as sales wingmen. They'll have context about past conversations, understand the demos, and they'll be able to answer questions without you being there.

**Stories that sell:** Great demos are more than just walkthroughs—they're narratives. "It's about creative storytelling," says Senthamil. "It's not just showing a bunch of different screens and then showing them what to click. It's specific to solving their real problems."

**Agent-on-agent action:** Senthamil envisions a future where AI agents handle [both sides of the sales call](https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-is-preparing-to-welcome-its-next-customer-the-ai-shopping-agent-6659ef18), with buying agents talking directly to selling agents. These AI reps won't just pitch—they'll remember past conversations, recap demos, and support internal decision-making.

"Think of these AI agents as sales wingmen," he says. "They'll have context about past conversations, understand the demos, and they'll be able to answer questions without you being there."

**Fewer calls, better leads:** Sure, humans will continue to be involved in the final stages. But according to Senthamil, the early stages of the funnel are going to be agentic. "Agents can help you filter and bring more qualified people into your pipeline," he says. It's going to be about less friction, better storytelling, and agents that don't sleep, ghost, or drop the ball.
