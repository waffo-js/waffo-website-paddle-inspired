Even as experts predict AI will rival human intelligence in the near future, many believe we still have a long way to go. One of the biggest obstacles is proper [integration and adoption](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work) into our daily workflows. AI capabilities will continue to advance, but understanding or implementing the newest technologies isn’t a given, and this is where forward-looking companies are seizing the biggest opportunities.

We spoke with [Bassam Aoun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bassam-aoun-12000220/), Vice President of AI/ML at [DocketAI](https://www.docketai.com/), about how the company is tackling this problem in the sales industry for [SaaS and other sales-heavy industries](https://www.paddle.com/solutions/launch). The company was founded by ZoomInfo alums and [raised a $15 million Series A](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/25/zoominfo-alum-raises-15m-for-startup-that-builds-ai-sales-engineers/) in mid-2024.

**Integration battles:** No matter how far AI has come, real-world implementation is lagging behind. "Even if AI in 2027 or 2028 can match human intelligence at all tasks, we're still far from doing it efficiently," Aoun says. "The human brain can operate with minimal energy, like having an oatmeal breakfast and a banana for four or five hours of activity. AI would need kilowatts. We don't have the energy or the infrastructure."

**Disrupting Sales:** The gap presents low-hanging fruit for specialized companies to [help businesses integrate AI](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250128623718/en/ISG-Study-Finds-AI-Boosts-Business-Service-Automation-at-U.S.-Enterprises) efficiently, a challenge that many are struggling to overcome. One industry ripe for [AI-driven transformation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/solrashidi/2025/01/30/the-future-of-work-ai-and-workforce-integration-for-scalable-success/) is [sales](https://tech.einnews.com/amp/pr_news/781370265/generative-ai-in-sales-market-projected-to-reach-usd-850-0-mn-by-2033). DocketAI is capitalizing on this by developing AI sales enablement agents designed to assist salespeople or even manage customer interactions independently.

"We have an AI sales enablement agent, a co-pilot version where a salesperson works alongside an agent. Down the road, we can spare the salesperson from being on every call or on the outbound initially and let this agent interface with the customer. We are working very hard on making it real-time because when you have a sales agent as a co-pilot with you on the call, it has to be high on accuracy, high on speed, and low on latency."

**Reading minds:** DocketAI is training its AI to sell products in a way that aligns with a company’s approach, "We want this [AI to learn how to sell](https://www.cio.com/article/3810965/ai-poised-to-overhaul-the-customer-journey.html) your product _your_ way, including the type of use cases to show, and what type of discovery questions to ask… We think it's going to make a huge impact in the market." With revenue [getting harder to come by](https://www.paddle.com/blog/saas-market-report-october-2024) in many industries, any advantage helps.
