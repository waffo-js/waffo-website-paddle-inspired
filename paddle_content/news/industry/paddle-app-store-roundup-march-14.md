In the latest news from the app industry: a new Android spyware, KoSpy, is linked to North Korea, an app-sharing feature goes AWOL from the Play Store, 12 apps in the Play Store have now surpassed 10 billion downloads, the EU is handing Apple and Meta a monetary slap on the wrist, and Brazil gives Apple 90 days to allow alternative app stores on iOS.

**Latest Android spyware linked to North Korea:** Researchers at cybersecurity company Lookout have identified [a new Android spyware](https://www.lookout.com/threat-intelligence/article/lookout-discovers-new-spyware-by-north-korean-apt37), KoSpy, attributed to North Korean cyber espionage group APT37 (also known as ScarCruft). Active since at least March 2022, KoSpy disguises itself as utility apps like "File Manager" and "Software Update Utility," targeting Korean and English-speaking users. Once installed, it collects extensive data, including SMS messages, call logs, location information, files, audio, and screenshots, using dynamically loaded plugins. Distribution channels include the Google Play Store and third-party app stores like APKpure.

**Quick Share feature vanishes:** Google has [quietly removed](https://www.phonearena.com/news/google-app-sharing-feature-play-store_id168341) the Play Store's app-sharing feature, introduced in 2021, which allowed users to share apps with nearby Android devices using Quick Share. This feature was particularly beneficial for users with limited or unreliable internet connectivity. The removal was noted in the latest Play Store update (version 45.2.19-31), though Google has not provided an official explanation for this decision. Users seeking alternative methods for offline app sharing can utilize Google's standalone Nearby Share app or the Files by Google app.

**The apps in Google's '10 billion' club:** Android Police has published a list of the 12 apps in the Google Play Store that have surpassed [10 billion downloads](https://www.androidpolice.com/google-play-store-10-billion-download-club-list/). The apps are Google Play Services, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Chrome, Gmail, Speech Services by Google, Google Search, Android Accessibility Suite, Google Drive, Google Photos, Gboard, and Google Play Store. Notice anything? Yes, they’re all applications developed by Google and often pre-installed on Android devices – no doubt a major contributing factor to their popularity.

**Small fines for big app stores:** The European Union is [preparing to impose](https://bgr.com/tech/apple-and-meta-to-get-modest-fines-in-the-eu-over-dma-violations/) modest fines on tech giants Apple and Meta for alleged violations of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which became law in May 2024. The DMA aims to enhance competition and consumer choice by regulating large digital "gatekeepers." While specific violations have not been disclosed, the European Commission has expressed concerns over the companies' compliance with the new regulations. Despite the potential for penalties of up to 10% of global annual sales under the DMA, the anticipated fines are expected to be relatively small, reflecting the EU's preference for encouraging compliance over punitive measures.

**Brazil follows EU's lead:**[Brazil has mandated](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3841386/brazil-tells-apple-to-open-up-perhaps-its-time-to-move-on.html) that Apple must permit alternative app stores on iOS devices within 90 days, echoing similar requirements imposed by the European Union's Digital Markets Act. This decision stems from a 2022 investigation initiated by a complaint from Mercado Livre. Apple plans to appeal, citing concerns over potential risks to user privacy and security. The ruling underscores a global trend challenging Apple's App Store exclusivity, prompting discussions on the company's need to adapt its business model in response to evolving regulatory landscapes.
