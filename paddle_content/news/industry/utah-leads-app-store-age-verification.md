Utah has become the first U.S. state to [pass legislation](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/utah-apps-stores-age-verification-first-state/) requiring app store operators to verify user ages and obtain parental consent before allowing minors to download apps. The "App Store Accountability Act" (S.B. 142) recently cleared the Utah State Legislature and now awaits Governor Spencer Cox's signature.

**Legislating for parental approval:** Under [the impending law](https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0142.html), app store providers like Apple and Google must request age information when users create accounts. If a minor attempts to register, the app store must link the account to a parent's and may require identification to confirm age. Parental approval will be necessary for minors to download apps that allow in-app purchases or require agreement to terms and conditions.

**Big Social likes the law:** The bill has garnered support from major social media companies such as Meta (owner of Facebook and Instagram), Snap, and X (formerly Twitter). They have advocated for centralized age verification at the app store level, arguing it simplifies the process for parents and enhances privacy.

In [a joint statement](https://utahnewsdispatch.com/briefs/utah-social-media-law-app-store-age-verification/) responding to Utah's move, the three companies said: "Parents want a one-stop shop to verify their child's age and grant permission for them to download apps in a privacy-preserving way. The app store is the best place for it."

**App platforms beg to differ:** Conversely, app store operators like Apple and Google have expressed reservations. They argue that app developers are better positioned to handle age verification and that requiring app stores to collect sensitive information from all users could compromise privacy and security. Apple has [previously argued](https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/Helping-Protect-Kids-Online-2025.pdf) that many children lack official IDs, making the verification process challenging and potentially intrusive.

**Wider consequences:** If Governor Cox signs the bill, most provisions will take effect on May 7, 2025. The legislation could set a precedent for [other states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_age_verification_laws_in_the_United_States) and potentially influence federal policies on digital age verification and online safety for minors.
