B2B data intelligence and sales engagement platform [Apollo](https://apollo.io/) has introduced a series of updates in recent months aimed at solidifying its position in the competitive sales intelligence market. The changes include product enhancements, leadership expansion, and a brand refresh.

**Fresh features:** The upgrades to Apollo's platform include improvements to [email deliverability](https://www.apollo.io/magazine/email-deliverability-upgrades-improving-open-rates) and the introduction of its new [Waterfall Enrichment](https://www.apollo.io/product/waterfall) feature. The company says its updated email infrastructure has resulted in a 30% increase in open rates, while the waterfall feature is an enhancement that searches multiple data sources to find and verify prospects' contact details.

**Bela steps in:** At the same time as launching enhancements to its current offering, Apollo has also appointed [Bela Stepanova](https://www.apollo.io/magazine/bela-stepanova-joins-apollo-as-chief-product-officer) as Chief Product Officer. Stepanova brings extensive AI-powered product development [experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/belastepanova) to the company, having previously headed product management at customer communication platform Iterable and content management company Box. At Apollo, she is expected to accelerate innovation in data intelligence and sales automation.

**Branding makeover:** In addition to technological improvements, Apollo has unveiled a comprehensive rebrand aimed at modernizing its visual identity and reinforcing its market positioning. The new branding includes an updated logo, refined color palette, and a more intuitive user interface.

**Fresh aesthetic:** "Historically, our product has been highly functional and utilitarian, but lacked cohesiveness and interconnection," Apollo’s VP of Design, [Rich Bessel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richbessel), explained in a post explaining the [rationale behind the rebrand](https://www.apollo.io/tech-blog/a-fresh-look-at-apollo-elevating-our-visual-identity). "Our new look is designed to better communicate Apollo’s role as a leader in the space and our continued focus on empowering sales professionals."
