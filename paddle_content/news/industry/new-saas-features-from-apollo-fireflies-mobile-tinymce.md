From AI-powered coding assistants to better data for GTMs and mobile transcription tools – these are the new features we're eyeing this week from a few of the hottest SaaS startups...

**For GTM teams looking for better contact data:** The all-in-one lead discovery and email sequencing tool [Apollo.io](https://www.apollo.io/) introduced [Waterfall Enrichment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pszndv-RYoYsXUJ0ljqTAkAUAFSm8235SL54HtzdjkI/edit?_hsenc=p2ANqtz--EwC-HsLmE7ORDuEal44aJGOfvMmQcuDA5Cb6ym10o8kO-RYZiS7-qXsdzMM8PXhYWZpG0dgcASz4k5NcnZ58ZmVBptw&_hsmi=342862239&tab=t.0) in closed beta to existing users. It enhances contact data by pulling emails and phone numbers from multiple data providers in a cascading order for better accuracy. 

Relative newcomers to the space like [Clay](https://www.clay.com/) already offer a waterfall enrichment feature as part of their AI-forward GTM suite. In Apollo, users will now be able to customize the sequence of providers and add email validation for extra accuracy, ensuring more reliable and complete information. Currently available to select beta customers, the feature is still evolving, with pricing and functionality subject to change.

**A new way of coding for the experienced dev:** Czech software development suite [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) has rolled out [Junie](https://www.jetbrains.com/junie/), an AI coding assistant. The tool is in early access for Linux and Mac users of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and PyCharm Professional. Junie automates routine coding tasks and enhances code quality. [According to TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/jetbrains-launches-junie-a-new-ai-coding-agent-for-its-ides/), its 53.6% success rate on the SWE-Bench benchmark lags behind top rivals scoring over 60%. While competitors like Weights & Biases lead in performance, Junie's seamless integration with JetBrains IDEs offers developers a unique advantage, with [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) compatibility on the horizon.

**Making AI transcriptions mobile:**[Fireflies.ai](http://Fireflies.ai) has [launched a mobile app](https://fireflies.ai/mobile) that brings its powerful AI notetaking tools to your pocket. Users can record, transcribe, and summarize meetings, interviews, and voice notes in over 60 languages, with support for uploading audio or video files.

The app makes it easy to skim transcripts, search key moments, and generate detailed summaries, while AI tools like AskFred help analyze conversations for metrics, action items, and more. It also offers collaboration features like timestamped comments and shareable soundbites for professionals who need productivity on the go.

**Optimizing images:** Popular dev-focused WYSIWYG text editor [Tiny Technologies](https://www.tiny.cloud/) has teamed up with [Uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com/) to launch the [TinyMCE Image Optimizer](https://www.tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/image-optimizer/), tackling web development challenges like site performance and image management. 

[The new feature](https://www.prweb.com/releases/tiny-technologies-launches-tinymce-image-optimizer-powered-by-uploadcare-302356344.html) boosts website load times and search engine rankings through responsive image adjustments and automatic optimization, all while maintaining compliance with SOC 2 and GDPR standards. By integrating Uploadcare's technology into its own, TinyMCE now offers developers and content creators streamlined workflows and nondestructive editing directly within the editor, eliminating the need for third-party tools and enhancing productivity.

**An even better journey:**[Midjourney announced](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Flogin%3Fredirect_to%3D%252Fchannels%252F662267976984297473%252F1037743153471553618%252F1326682666958979168) it's on the brink of launching V7, a major update that revamps its AI image generator with new architecture and data sets, while also exploring video generation capabilities. 

The update is in final testing, with an [alpha phase expected soon](https://decrypt.co/300298/midjourney-inches-closer-to-complete-overhaul-plans-video-features), and aims to balance speed, cost, and quality for video creation in a potential rival to [OpenAI's Sora](https://openai.com/index/sora-is-here/).
