Data automation and AI-powered research platform [Clay](https://www.clay.com/) has announced a [community equity offering](https://www.clay.com/blog/community-equity-offering), allowing its users and supporters to become shareholders in the company. It's an unusual move: few technology startups have directly extended ownership opportunities to their user bases.

**About the company:**[Clay's platform](https://betakit.com/canadian-founded-clay-achieves-unicorn-status-with-57-5-million-raise/) helps go-to-market teams streamline lead generation, automate data enrichment, and personalize customer outreach using AI-driven insights. Companies wanting to automate their sales and marketing workflows use Clay to enrich their CRM data, track buying signals, and create highly targeted outbound campaigns.

**Rewarding its community:** Unlike traditional equity distribution models that focus on venture capitalists and employees, Clay's community equity offering is fairly unique in that it allows users to share in the company’s success. The company said the initiative was designed to recognize and reward the community that has played a significant role in its growth.

"This is a group of people who have stood with us from the very beginning, the true believers who quite literally built this product alongside us," Clay co-founder Varun Anand [said on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vaanand_this-is-years-in-the-making-were-opening-activity-7298028630046093312-nyR9). "We believe the people who helped build Clay should benefit from its future."

**Rare opportunity:** While employee stock option plans are common, and some companies have experimented with customer-based equity programs, few have implemented a structured initiative like Clay's. Other firms, [such as T-Mobile](https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/un-carrier-11), have experimented with customer stock rewards, and some equity crowdfunding platforms have provided similar opportunities, but Clay's model stands out as a direct and intentional effort to acknowledge user contributions.
