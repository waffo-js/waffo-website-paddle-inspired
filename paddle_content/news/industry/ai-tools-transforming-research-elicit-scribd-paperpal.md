From AI-driven academic writing assistants, to automated research synthesis, and enhanced content discovery – here's a roundup of the latest innovations aimed at empowering researchers, students, and hobbiest knowledge seekers alike.

**Growing with Google:** [Paperpal,](https://paperpal.com/) the AI-powered writing toolkit for researchers and students, has launched [Paperpal for Google Docs](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/paperpal_best_free_grammar_checker_for_a/726869145658) to bring advanced grammar, spell checking, and academic proofreading directly into its popular writing platform. Unlike generic grammar tools, Paperpal is trained on millions of scholarly articles, ensuring precise academic tone alignment, nuanced language corrections, and technical term accuracy. The integration offers real-time editing support, helping users refine their work seamlessly without leaving Docs.

**Funding reports:** AI research analysis and assistant tool [Elicit](https://elicit.com/) has launched [Elicit Reports](https://blog.elicit.com/introducing-elicit-reports/), a fully automated research overview tool designed for those who need rigorous, evidence-backed insights. Inspired by [systematic reviews](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5903119/)—the gold standard for synthesizing scientific literature—Elicit Reports aims to provide researchers with accurate, trustworthy summaries with greater transparency and control over how AI processes their work.

Unlike other deep research tools that cater to broad and informal consumer use cases, Elicit serves [high-stakes fields](https://elicit.com/#Testimonials) where precision is critical. The company is well-capitalized to win, having just raised [$22M in Series A funding](https://blog.elicit.com/series-a/) at a $100M valuation.

**Fresh look, same mission:** User-powered document library giant [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/) unveiled a [new design](https://www.instagram.com/scribd/) aimed at improving discovery and accessibility across its platform. With a massive library of over 200 million pieces of content, Scribd democratizes information access with ad-supported reading, allowing users to explore primary source documents, research materials, and expert insights. [The redesign](https://support.scribd.com/hc/en-us/articles/35088488447508-The-new-look-of-Scribd) introduces improved navigation and synthesis tools, making it easier to extract key insights and link takeaways across multiple sources. As Scribd refines its discovery experience, users can expect even more features to help them engage with a vast collection of ebooks, audiobooks, and research documents.
