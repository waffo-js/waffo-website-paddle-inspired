The wellness app market is booming, surging nearly 15% annually as more consumers turn to technology to track and enhance their health. With demand skyrocketing, the industry is on track to surpass $26 billion by 2030.

**Business is healthy:** According to a [market analysis report](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/30/3018251/28124/en/Wellness-Apps-Market-Size-Share-Trends-Analysis-Report-2025-2030-Featuring-Mindscape-Calm-Headspace-Google-Appster-Under-Armour-Kayla-Itsines-Apple-Sleepace-and-Withings.html) by research firm Research and Markets, the global wellness apps market is expected to reach $26.19 billion by 2030. Research and Markets says the growth is due to increased use of wearable devices combined with greater awareness and concern about health issues.

**Prosperity through partnerships:** "Governments, tech companies, and healthcare organizations are actively investing in wellness apps and digital health startups, creating a helpful regulatory environment and promoting the development of solutions ranging from telehealth to wearable devices," Research and Markets says. "The major players operating in the market are adopting strategies such as collaborations, partnerships, acquisitions, and mergers with a major focus on enhancing product formation and reach."

**Recent developments:** Examples of wellness app companies collaborating with government and industry in 2025 include:

  * A partnership between [Headspace and the U.S. Navy](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/digital-health/headspace-inks-partnership-us-navy-and-explores-conversational-ai-mental-health) to provide free mental health coaching and wellbeing, mental strength training, and sleep content to 25,000 active-duty Sailors and their families.
  * Mattress maker [Tempur-Pedic partnering with Calm](https://sleepreviewmag.com/sleep-health/parameters/quality/new-partnership-brings-sleep-content-tempur-pedic-smart-bases/) to offer exclusive sleep and mindfulness content through its TEMPUR-Ergo Smart Bases.


Opportunities in the growing market are encouraging new players, like New York City-based startup Neurofit, which has combined neuroscience with AI to build an app that incorporates somatic exercises to [help treat chronic stress](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-small-business-neurofit-uses-ai-to-combat-chronic-stress-2025-3).

**Happy to pay:** Research and Markets' report shows the exercise and weight loss apps segment dominated the wellness apps market and accounted for the largest revenue share of almost 60%. Paid apps accounted for two-thirds of the market. "Increasing consumer willingness to invest in personalized wellness experiences is driving segmental growth," the research firm said.
