The number of paid music subscriptions in the U.S. has officially crossed the 100 million mark for the first time, according to the Recording Industry Association of America’s [2024 year-end report](https://www.riaa.com/2024-year-end-music-industry-revenue-report-riaa/).

**Streaming steams ahead:** The RIAA report shows the industry experienced a [3% increase in total revenue](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/us-paid-music-subscribers-cross-100-million-mark-for-the-first-time/), reaching $17.7 billion in estimated retail value. ​Streaming services continue to be the primary revenue driver, accounting for 84% of total revenues. Paid subscription services within this category grew by 5% to $11.7 billion, representing nearly two-thirds of total revenue.

**Vinyl persists:** Physical format revenues saw a 5% increase, totaling $2 billion. Vinyl records experienced their eighteenth consecutive year of growth, with revenues rising 7% to $1.4 billion. Vinyl albums outsold CDs for the third year in a row, with 44 million units shipped compared to 33 million CDs.

**​Downloading drops:** Meanwhile, revenue from digitally downloaded music continued its downward trend, decreasing by 18% to $336 million. Downloads now account for just 2% of U.S. recorded music revenues, down from a peak of 43% in 2012. ​

**Price hikes tolerated:** Spotify, the market leader in paid subscriptions, [raised its individual plan price](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/24/23805364/spotify-us-price-increase-10-99-a-month-9-99-month-twelve-years) in the U.S. from $9.99 to $10.99 in 2023, with Apple and Amazon following suit. Despite initial concerns over consumer pushback, subscriber growth remained strong, suggesting that users are willing to pay more for enhanced services and a seamless experience.

**Future trends:** Looking ahead, the industry is eyeing growth in [immersive audio](https://www.bigrapidsnews.com/news/article/napster-infinite-reality-acquisition-20239966.php), [AI-powered music recommendations](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/spotify-expands-ai-playlist-feature-new-markets-including-us-canada-2024-09-24/), and [global expansion](https://routenote.com/blog/ifpi-global-music-report-2025/). But for now, surpassing the 100 million mark cements the U.S. as the world’s largest and most lucrative subscription streaming market.
