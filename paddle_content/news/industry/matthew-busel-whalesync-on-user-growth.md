> Over the years, we realized that people just love working with spreadsheets. It’s not something that’s going to change anytime soon. It's kind of funny, but that’s the reality. People can spend time building out the most amazing tool, but at the end of the day, they’ll always return to spreadsheets.

When the world is buzzing with promises of AI-driven innovation, it's easy to assume that the newest technologies will always be the [chosen winner with customers](https://www.bazaarvoice.com/blog/changing-consumer-preferences-insights-and-trends/). But what if the secret to growth lies in sticking with [what people already know and love](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/consumer-behavior)? It’s an approach that has proven successful for Whalesync, a company that’s built its success by making workflows easier without forcing users to abandon familiar tools.

[Matthew Busel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-busel/), Co-founder of [Whalesync](https://www.whalesync.com/), explains how understanding the deeply ingrained preferences of users has been the foundation of their product’s growth. Whalesync allows users to manage apps [directly from spreadsheets](https://www.whalesync.com/solution/spreadsheet-to-spreadsheet) via two-way data sharing platform.

**Don’t take my spreadsheets:** "Over the years, we realized that people just love working with spreadsheets," Busel states. "It’s not something that’s going to change anytime soon. It's kind of funny, but that’s the reality. People can spend time building out the most amazing tool, but at the end of the day, they’ll always return to spreadsheets."

He continues, "What we’ve noticed is that almost every connection our tool makes is between a spreadsheet and another app. So, we leaned into that and focused on making it easier for people to sync their data across platforms without forcing them to abandon their preferred tools."

> The features we prioritize are ones that help customers right now, versus jumping on flashy trends. We’re aware that AI is coming, and we’re preparing for it. But we’re not going to rush into implementing AI just for the sake of it.

**Not reinventing the wheel:** Rather than creating an entirely new system, Whalesync focuses on improving the tools that already work for people. Their platform allows users to edit data in apps directly from their favorite spreadsheet tools, like Airtable, [Notion](https://www.fastcompany.com/91271149/notion-most-innovative-companies-2025), or [Google](https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/google-agreement-acquire-wiz/) Sheets. With a simple two-way sync, users can manage data across platforms like Webflow and HubSpot without leaving their trusted spreadsheets behind.

**No flashy trends:** This simplicity and reliance on familiar tools are key to Whalesync’s appeal. While many software companies race to incorporate the latest AI trends, Whalesync is focused on ensuring that their core product genuinely solves immediate problems for users. "The features we prioritize are ones that [help customers right now](https://www.pymnts.com/pymnts-data-lab/2025/decoding-the-connected-consumer-how-they-pay-for-tech/), versus jumping on flashy trends," Busel explains. "We’re aware that AI is coming, and we’re preparing for it. But we’re not going to rush into implementing AI just for the sake of it."

**Serving enterprises:** Whalesync’s focus on user-centric innovation has enabled the company to grow from serving small teams to working with some of the fastest-growing companies in the country, including Webflow, [Descript](https://www.fastcompany.com/91270234/video-most-innovative-companies-fast-company-2025-youtube-roku-tubi-vimeo-captions-descript-cour-procreate-synthesia-beeble), and Vanta. "It’s exciting to see how far we’ve come," Busel says. "What started with just a few customers has transformed into serving high-growth companies, and we’re looking to expand into serving thousands of companies in the near future."
