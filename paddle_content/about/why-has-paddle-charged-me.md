In some instances, we will be under instruction to follow the refund policies of the particular product or service supplier the transaction relates to. Visit their website for details.

## Why do software companies sell through Paddle?

By handling transactions for the software companies we work with, Paddle takes care of a lot of [complicated back-office work](https://www.paddle.com/platform), like global banking, managing foreign exchange, and filing [sales taxes internationally](/blog/saas-sales-tax-state-wide-and-international). This frees up the company's time and resources to focus on other things, like improving its products.
